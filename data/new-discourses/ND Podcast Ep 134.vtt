00:00.000 --> 00:23.280
Hey everybody, and welcome to another episode of the New Discourses podcast.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.340
This is James Lindsay.

00:24.340 --> 00:25.800
We got to talk about fascism.

00:25.800 --> 00:32.280
We spend a lot of time talking about communism, obviously I've dedicated most of my project

00:32.280 --> 00:38.060
to that, but we should talk a little bit about fascism too, and I want to actually, what

00:38.060 --> 00:42.240
I'm going to do in this episode is I'm going to actually read to you from Mussolini.

00:42.240 --> 00:50.160
I'm going to read to you The Doctrine of Fascism by Benito Mussolini, which he articulated.

00:50.160 --> 00:54.600
It's written as an article, I assume he wrote it down, but maybe he spoke it.

00:54.600 --> 01:00.120
It also borrows from a lot of quotes that are given as footnotes that I'll present to

01:00.120 --> 01:04.960
you as well for context, but this is from 1932, and I don't think you're going to find

01:04.960 --> 01:09.120
a more clear articulation of the principles of fascism.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.000
So let's put the dates on this.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
We're looking at this being in 1932.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.440
The fascists have had a fair amount of power in Italy for a while.

01:18.440 --> 01:22.800
We can know that, for example, just from our understanding of communist history because

01:22.800 --> 01:28.360
the fascists were the ones who locked up Antonio Gramsci, and they locked up Antonio Gramsci,

01:28.360 --> 01:32.740
obviously the father of cultural Marxism, in 1926.

01:32.740 --> 01:39.720
And so at this point, the fascists have had power for a little while, and Mussolini is

01:39.720 --> 01:46.280
now writing down the principles of, or the doctrine of fascism itself.

01:46.280 --> 01:52.120
What I'm reading to you is an article that's on the web that is a complete translation

01:52.120 --> 02:00.320
of the doctrine of fascism with added context in footnotes that was written together, not

02:00.320 --> 02:07.520
just by Benito Mussolini himself, but co-written with another guy, Giovanni Gentile, and it

02:07.520 --> 02:12.680
says, their note about it is, it is considered to be the most complete articulation of Mussolini's

02:12.680 --> 02:14.360
political views.

02:14.360 --> 02:18.800
This is the only complete official translation we know of on the web, copied directly from

02:18.800 --> 02:24.400
an official fascist government publication of 1935, which was titled Fascism Doctrine

02:24.400 --> 02:30.200
and Institutions, published under the name of Benito Mussolini, and all the original

02:30.200 --> 02:32.240
footnotes it says are included.

02:32.240 --> 02:37.500
So I guess those footnotes were not added by this website, but are actually original.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.600
Now I want to frame this before we talk about it because I don't want to just say, oh, here's

02:41.600 --> 02:42.600
some fascism.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.580
That's what we're doing here.

02:44.580 --> 02:45.580
Why on earth?

02:45.580 --> 02:49.420
In fact, I've been wanting to make this podcast for like a month and I'm like, I don't know

02:49.420 --> 02:51.580
why I want, like, I want to present this.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.580
I want people to see this, but I don't know why.

02:54.580 --> 02:59.620
I don't know the explanation and I've been thinking about it really hard for a long time

02:59.620 --> 03:04.300
and I finally have kind of come across what it is and you would think that maybe what

03:04.300 --> 03:11.120
I want to talk about is this obvious rise on the weird kind of cool kids right or whatever

03:11.120 --> 03:18.360
we want to call these guys, the new right, the dissident right, the alt right, the reactionary

03:18.360 --> 03:19.360
right.

03:19.360 --> 03:24.400
I don't know what to call these people, but it's infiltrated, of course, heavily into

03:24.400 --> 03:26.680
what we might consider movement conservatism.

03:26.680 --> 03:31.440
It's kind of like the conservative ink, like hard edge angle plus the groipers, which is

03:31.440 --> 03:33.600
that's the whole Nick Fuentes thing.

03:33.600 --> 03:41.020
That whole angle is just rife with this bend toward fascism, not in like, hey, that kind

03:41.020 --> 03:43.940
of looks like fascism, but explicitly.

03:43.940 --> 03:47.680
And whether they're real accounts or whether they're bots or whether they're something

03:47.680 --> 03:53.580
else on social media, if you bring up anything related to this, there are all these apparently

03:53.580 --> 03:59.300
super pro right wing accounts all over Twitter, at least that are like, yeah, fascism is the

03:59.300 --> 04:00.620
only way.

04:00.620 --> 04:05.620
But now we're starting to see influencers in the conservative space saying like Franco

04:05.620 --> 04:09.420
was great, fascism is necessary.

04:09.420 --> 04:15.700
And I think one of the ones I saw last night that really disturbed me was this general

04:15.700 --> 04:20.940
idea that, well, maybe I don't really want fascism, but if it comes down to a binary

04:20.940 --> 04:25.900
choice between fascism and communism, I'm going to choose fascism.

04:25.900 --> 04:30.380
And so we've got to understand what fascism is.

04:30.380 --> 04:34.540
And I'm going to read Mussolini so you understand what fascism is in that regard.

04:34.540 --> 04:40.700
But we've got to take a step back because this is all part of dialectical leftism.

04:40.700 --> 04:45.440
Fascism is the right hand of the left that has to be understood.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.260
Now why would I say that?

04:48.260 --> 04:51.740
Well let's back up to Hegel.

04:51.740 --> 04:56.920
Actually let's back up even to Kant and talk about this dialectical way of thinking.

04:56.920 --> 05:01.120
The dialectic per Kant is that you have the thesis and then there's the antithesis and

05:01.120 --> 05:03.160
somehow you mix them together to get a synthesis.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.100
But that's an extremely incorrect understanding.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.680
Of course Hegel had it differently.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.720
He never said it in terms of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.760
He said it in terms of there's the abstract and then you meet its negation and then you

05:14.760 --> 05:19.560
arrive at the concrete through the synthetic dialectical process.

05:19.560 --> 05:26.640
But what is actually articulated is not that there is the thesis and its antithesis floating

05:26.640 --> 05:28.520
around out there.

05:28.520 --> 05:38.040
It is in fact that the antithesis or the negation arises from within the thing.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.040
Do you get that?

05:39.040 --> 05:41.800
That's absolutely crucial to understand.

05:41.800 --> 05:52.280
The antithesis is actually opposed to the thesis but it arises from within the thesis.

05:52.280 --> 05:56.160
It's not floating around out there as the opposite that you're going to find like black

05:56.160 --> 05:57.840
versus white.

05:57.840 --> 06:03.220
It actually arises from within the thesis.

06:03.220 --> 06:08.280
So when you have an abstract conception for Hegel and this is all Hegelian dialectical

06:08.280 --> 06:19.200
manipulation, fascism is a dialectical phenomenon and when you have with Hegel this abstract

06:19.200 --> 06:23.640
notion that you're thinking oh well here's communism or here's whatever it happens to

06:23.640 --> 06:27.640
be and we're going to take the next step but we're going to dig into it and deeper and

06:27.680 --> 06:31.480
deeper and deeper do that we're going to understand it at its deepest level and as we deeper

06:31.480 --> 06:37.720
deeper deeper and dig into it where what do we find oh the opposite its opposite its negation

06:37.720 --> 06:39.960
is hidden within it.

06:39.960 --> 06:45.320
That thing that challenges it that turns it backwards in upon itself is hidden within

06:45.320 --> 06:50.520
it and then the goal is to realize and to put it in the language of the principle of

06:50.520 --> 06:57.040
polarity from the original hermetic doctrines that inspired all of us in the first place.

06:57.040 --> 07:03.160
The goal is to realize that the antithesis is the same in kind but different in degree

07:03.160 --> 07:08.560
and fascism I think we're going to hear very clearly from Mussolini is the antithesis of

07:08.560 --> 07:14.000
Marxism is the antithesis of communism but that doesn't mean that it's the opposite or

07:14.000 --> 07:17.520
the actual the enemy of communism at all.

07:17.520 --> 07:23.740
It is the same in kind but different in degree in other words it's the same thing presenting

07:23.740 --> 07:30.060
in an oppositional way and that's what when we hear fascism you're going to hear one of

07:30.060 --> 07:37.180
the principles Mussolini puts forth in fact is explicitly a rejection of Marxism and so

07:37.180 --> 07:46.220
from within Marxism arises this antithesis this opposite this negation so within communism

07:46.220 --> 07:52.180
arises fascism fascism is same in kind it's still a totalitarian doctrine we're going

07:52.180 --> 07:57.820
to hear that too it's different in degree it's still a state worshiping doctrine but

07:57.820 --> 08:02.580
it isn't worshiping the state the same way in fact I've argued in the past that communism

08:02.580 --> 08:06.820
if you want to put it kind of in the Christian trinity which you actually should communism

08:06.820 --> 08:12.340
actually sees the state in the position of the sun in the position of Christ it is a

08:12.340 --> 08:18.200
self-sacrificial entity that will liberate man by killing itself in the end that's actually

08:18.200 --> 08:22.600
the belief in communism is that socialism will rise to a zenith of power at which point

08:22.600 --> 08:27.760
it will become unnecessary and wither away the state will sacrifice itself to liberate

08:27.760 --> 08:34.520
all people after it transforms them into purely socialist man which is to say really returns

08:34.520 --> 08:39.480
them to their true human nature because that's the belief at the heart of Marxism is that

08:39.480 --> 08:44.100
the true human nature is a social creative being and that we've forgotten that because

08:44.100 --> 08:50.060
we've been imposed upon by the bourgeois elements of society within both in theory

08:50.060 --> 08:57.380
and in practice within that however because it's a dialectical concept is its negation

08:57.380 --> 09:03.380
and its negation is fascism fascism arises from the fear and desperation that is caused

09:03.380 --> 09:10.300
by communism communism I think pretty clearly is caused by some combination of laziness

09:10.300 --> 09:18.340
sloth and envy and resentment it's very clearly that and you kind of codify that into a social

09:18.340 --> 09:23.260
gnostic religion and you get this Marxist communism well it turns out when you provoke

09:23.260 --> 09:27.820
people when you do the praxis of communism it freaks people out people think they're

09:27.820 --> 09:32.820
going to lose their society and if they don't stand up right they will and what do you do

09:32.820 --> 09:36.120
well you have to stand up and you wait and you put it off and you delay and things get

09:36.120 --> 09:39.580
really desperate and you get really scared and that fear and desperation that arises

09:39.580 --> 09:44.180
causes people to want to band together or bind together like a bundle of sticks fascio

09:44.180 --> 09:51.260
in Italian and adopt a fascist attitude a new totalitarian attitude to fight back against

09:51.260 --> 09:55.580
communists but in fact what you're actually doing is adopting totalitarianism anyway it's

09:55.580 --> 10:00.380
the same in kind but different in degree and what happens in the end the point of the dialectic

10:00.380 --> 10:06.180
isn't that there's just this thesis and antithesis this thing and it's negation it's in fact

10:06.180 --> 10:11.380
that the thing in his negation the negation arises from within the thing itself and then

10:11.380 --> 10:16.580
they are placed intrinsically into conflict and through that conflict the contradictions

10:16.580 --> 10:23.060
are worked out so that a synthetic hole that sees both sides of those things in the same

10:23.060 --> 10:30.660
light can arise that's the idea so the goal is actually that if fascism is the dialectical

10:30.660 --> 10:36.580
antithesis to communism is that the two are not there to fight one another they're there

10:36.580 --> 10:42.800
to merge together into one totalitarian system that actually controls everything and that's

10:42.800 --> 10:47.300
exactly what we see in the latter half of the 20th century which is a story nobody seems

10:47.300 --> 10:52.340
to know if you look at the success well if you look at the Soviet system or you look

10:52.340 --> 10:58.460
at the even Mao's Chinese system the CCP system they didn't work they were complete catastrophes

10:58.460 --> 11:01.740
now you could say that they've been very successful at subverting and infiltrating

11:01.740 --> 11:06.420
and the Cold War never ended you can say all those things quite intelligently but what's

11:06.420 --> 11:11.020
really kept the socialist movement alive especially in China is the fact that Deng Xiaoping came

11:11.020 --> 11:18.300
along as Mao's successor in the late 1970s and adopted a model with a contained market

11:18.300 --> 11:22.260
they claimed that they were opening up a market but Deng Xiaoping said it was always said

11:22.260 --> 11:26.540
it was for socialism it was for the glory of socialism they were just trying to get

11:26.540 --> 11:31.500
China back on its productive feet because Mao absolutely destroyed it with his own cult

11:31.500 --> 11:36.820
and the CCP opened a market but it's really a Potemkin market it's not a real market it's

11:36.820 --> 11:44.300
a phony market that is at the pleasure and at the behest of the CCP if you buck the CCP

11:44.300 --> 11:49.300
your standing in the market goes away but as long as you play ball it looks like you

11:49.300 --> 11:53.080
get to run your company you get to own your company you get to make a ton of money you

11:53.080 --> 11:57.000
end up with crazy rich Asians blah blah blah everybody there is trying to make money turns

11:57.000 --> 12:03.560
out that that system is not a market that system is fascism that's exactly what fascism

12:03.560 --> 12:09.680
did even in Italy even in Germany in the early part of the 20th century 50 years earlier

12:09.680 --> 12:14.400
what it did was it allowed people to look like they were still owning their own corporations

12:14.400 --> 12:19.360
but the corporations actually operated as functionaries of the state so people were

12:19.360 --> 12:25.760
able to make money production was very high the fascist model unlike the communist model

12:25.760 --> 12:30.680
is actually very successful at production what it's not successful at is freedom what

12:30.680 --> 12:35.120
it's not successful at is liberty but of course being dialectical they claim that they have

12:35.120 --> 12:39.020
a higher understanding of what liberty and freedom actually mean and they have the only

12:39.020 --> 12:43.360
true freedom we'll hear that from Mussolini we know that the communists believe that we

12:43.360 --> 12:47.600
know that the fascists also well we will know the fascists also believe that but more importantly

12:47.600 --> 12:51.480
what you see is a synthetic model that was developed in China that's now being copied

12:51.480 --> 12:57.360
here in the West whether through ESG or natural asset companies or the public-private partnership

12:57.360 --> 13:01.720
or the stakeholder capitalism or whatever terms we use for their new sustainability

13:01.720 --> 13:06.280
agenda that is the same model that's happening in the CCP and what it is is that you're using

13:06.280 --> 13:12.800
corporate subsidiarity to the state power there's actually one corporation that's corporation

13:12.800 --> 13:17.800
is the state and then under that you have subsidiary shell corporations that operate

13:17.800 --> 13:23.120
underneath the auspices of what the state wants and allows and its doctrine that's fascism

13:23.120 --> 13:28.780
and they get to make crazy money so long as they prove high levels of duty and loyalty

13:28.780 --> 13:34.720
everybody else gets screwed by the way the average person is not doing better than they

13:34.720 --> 13:39.360
would under freedom and what happens is the goal is well you're going to need some kind

13:39.360 --> 13:43.360
of a socialistic distribution model and to make sure that the regular people who don't

13:43.360 --> 13:48.080
own the big huge corporations that are the subsidiaries of the state corporation have

13:48.080 --> 13:53.360
have their amount or share and you're going to have basically something that works just

13:53.360 --> 13:57.640
like a communist social credit system to make sure that their distribution is determined

13:57.640 --> 14:01.080
correctly whether it's a distribution of labor that they have to do that they don't want

14:01.080 --> 14:06.120
to do or a distribution of goods and services or universal basic income or social credit

14:06.120 --> 14:12.740
or whatever it is that allows them to make way and so what you have to understand are

14:12.740 --> 14:16.080
two big pieces and then we're going to talk about we're going to read Mussolini and the

14:16.080 --> 14:22.880
two big pieces are first number one that fascism is the antithesis or the negation of communism

14:22.880 --> 14:26.660
but understood in a dialectical process what that means is that fascism is actually the

14:26.660 --> 14:33.080
bastard son of communism it is an offspring of communism it is not something that people

14:33.080 --> 14:39.700
want except if they want to gain totalitarian power and the communist attempt isn't working

14:39.700 --> 14:44.480
it is a reaction to communism as well but that's because it's the negation that arises

14:44.480 --> 14:51.640
from within it and that the goal of a dialectical pair of opposites there is a same in kind

14:51.640 --> 14:58.760
but different in degree or different in form same in kind same totalitarian system same

14:58.760 --> 15:05.800
statist religion same catastrophe for the average person but on the other hand it's

15:05.800 --> 15:11.400
different in degree so that the two can be synthesized and the project whether we look

15:11.400 --> 15:15.160
at it in terms of Deng Xiaoping whether we look at it in terms of what Herbert Marcuse

15:15.160 --> 15:20.440
was writing in one-dimensional manth in the 1960s and also in the essay on liberation

15:20.440 --> 15:25.520
in the 1960s and encounter revolution and revolt in the early 1970s when we read Marcuse

15:25.520 --> 15:29.720
we see very clearly that he has this issue and I've talked about this I've done podcasts

15:29.720 --> 15:32.800
on this I've written essays about this I eventually should probably write a book but I already

15:32.800 --> 15:40.080
wrote the essay so I don't know what to do explaining that the model was that capitalism

15:40.080 --> 15:45.440
has the ability to produce but it's not sustainable so you need a sustainable capitalism paired

15:45.440 --> 15:50.440
alongside dialectically paired alongside socialism which has the right ideology but it can't

15:50.440 --> 15:54.960
produce so we need a productive socialism and a sustainable capitalism that become increasingly

15:54.960 --> 15:59.800
close to the same model well those models are going to have to be distributist in nature

15:59.800 --> 16:05.700
and distributism becomes the overarching brand that does it and what we have then is these

16:05.700 --> 16:10.360
Potemkin markets like in China and like they're building under stakeholder capitalism that

16:10.360 --> 16:14.640
are fascism but the reaction that we're having here just like throughout all of history is

16:14.640 --> 16:20.720
a reaction to create same in kind but different in degree a fascist reaction and what happens

16:20.720 --> 16:26.800
in practice like take for example the Franco did Franco save Spain well it's run by socialists

16:26.800 --> 16:31.760
right now so at least in the longer run of history the answer is no no he did not in

16:31.760 --> 16:36.440
fact what happens is these fascist systems don't tend to work they are very high at productivity

16:36.440 --> 16:41.960
they tend to be very for a while they tend to repel communism but they're utterly totalitarian

16:41.960 --> 16:47.540
people become dissatisfied people get deposed people get murdered people the whole totalitarian

16:47.540 --> 16:51.800
nightmare is still happening and the whole thing becomes unstable it's held together

16:51.800 --> 16:57.800
typically by a military dictator who when he dies or his family dynasty falls apart

16:57.800 --> 17:01.580
the whole thing falls apart and you end up handing a century of moral authority to the

17:01.580 --> 17:07.020
left plus an apparatus that's already stopped defending human rights or individual rights

17:07.020 --> 17:09.580
I shouldn't say human rights human rights is some bullshit that's out of the United

17:09.580 --> 17:15.800
Nations the individual rights individual rights end up on that sacrificed on the altar to

17:15.800 --> 17:19.840
build the fascist state and when then when the fascist state falls apart because it's

17:19.840 --> 17:24.400
actually a totalitarian nightmare and it's usually held together again by a military

17:24.400 --> 17:31.760
style dictator when that falls apart and it inevitably does you hand that apparatus plus

17:31.760 --> 17:36.400
a century's worth of unassailable moral authority to the other side so that you just made the

17:36.400 --> 17:40.720
job so much easier for the socialists who are going to come in and say well the excesses

17:40.720 --> 17:44.520
of the right were awfully terrible and awfully bad and awfully scary so we're going to do

17:44.520 --> 17:50.020
this correctly now we're going to do this in the name not of oppression but of the oppressed

17:50.020 --> 17:54.040
and it's not hard to get massive public sentiment behind it and you see that in South America

17:54.040 --> 17:58.800
again and again you see that in Spain you see that in Greece you see that in lots of

17:58.800 --> 18:03.440
places that have tried to experiment with this strongman bullshit that always backfires

18:03.440 --> 18:07.980
in the end and it makes you wonder why this is getting pushed on the so-called dissident

18:07.980 --> 18:14.440
right or new right or whatever right idiot right fucking idiot right right now as we

18:14.440 --> 18:21.000
go into a obviously highly important and contentious election year besides the fact

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
that obviously what it's going to do is give argument to all of the insane claims of the

18:26.000 --> 18:31.580
left making those things come true reifying the left's boogeyman so that it scares your

18:31.580 --> 18:38.340
average middle you know middling voter your average low information democrat voter who's

18:38.340 --> 18:41.980
getting real scared that stuff's not working economically that they're doing weird stuff

18:41.980 --> 18:45.720
with the kids that the schools are out of control and failing they're becoming cognizant

18:45.720 --> 18:49.720
that the left thing's failing whatever is going on with this whole israel-palestine

18:49.720 --> 18:54.160
they're getting cognizant that something's not right well better get them back scared

18:54.160 --> 18:59.280
as shit of the republicans and of the conservatives by coming out hard with fascism and a bunch

18:59.280 --> 19:04.800
of misogyny and hating women and badgering women for existing and whatever else and trying

19:04.800 --> 19:09.060
to say that you want to repeal the 19th and take away their vote and like the whole thing

19:09.060 --> 19:14.640
is designed to lose but at any rate let's pretend it's not let's pretend it's not a

19:14.640 --> 19:23.660
pitfall it's designed to lose let's hear in mussolini's own words what fascism is so we

19:23.660 --> 19:31.000
begin like all this is mussolini writing in the 1930s on the doctrine of fascism like

19:31.000 --> 19:38.560
all sound political conceptions fascism is action and it is thought okay so it's theory

19:38.560 --> 19:42.560
and praxis just like communism because it's the same in kind but different in degree got

19:42.560 --> 19:49.400
you fascism is action and it is thought action in which doctrine is imminent that's exactly

19:49.400 --> 19:54.360
what the point of communism is i could go read to you 30 sources like in a flash i could

19:54.360 --> 20:01.400
pull up the definition of truth where uh on marxists.org where um they say that the there's

20:01.400 --> 20:04.860
different definitions of truth there's the empirical definition where we check evidence

20:04.860 --> 20:08.860
there's a rational where it has to be logically consistent there's the pragmatist where it's

20:08.860 --> 20:13.540
what works is considered true and he says that the communist version of the marxist

20:13.540 --> 20:19.220
version of truth is closest to the pragmatist it's what works but it has to also be in line

20:19.220 --> 20:25.780
with theory in other words it is action praxis in which doctrine is imminent so here we are

20:25.780 --> 20:30.980
we're not even through the first sentence and it's obvious that fascism is the same

20:30.980 --> 20:37.220
formulation of communism that is same in kind different in degree in other words another

20:37.220 --> 20:42.420
way to phrase that would be two branches same tree like all sound political conceptions

20:42.420 --> 20:48.780
fascism is action and it is thought action in which doctrine is imminent and doctrine

20:48.780 --> 20:54.640
arising from a given system of historical forces in which it is inserted and working

20:54.640 --> 21:04.920
on them from within ps guys that's exactly the same idea in communism that is exactly

21:04.920 --> 21:09.640
the same idea there's these historical forces where a part of them those historical forces

21:09.640 --> 21:16.080
determine the necessary framework of our doctrine for a utilitarian uh application in order

21:16.080 --> 21:20.600
to gain power in order to be able to do our action and our action is going to be reflective

21:20.600 --> 21:26.640
against the doctrine and our doctrine is going to be reflective against the the the

21:26.640 --> 21:31.880
action in its results in the world because it's a scientific conception a mechanistic

21:31.880 --> 21:38.720
conception of how politics should work mussolini there then says it therefore has a form correlated

21:38.720 --> 21:44.800
to contingencies of time and space yet again we're seeing same in kind different in degree

21:44.800 --> 21:48.800
the marxists in particular the postmodernists that came right after this were very much

21:48.800 --> 21:52.940
so interested in saying that everything's contingent to time and space but marx himself

21:52.940 --> 21:58.560
was very interested in pointing out that politics is completely contingent to time and space

21:58.560 --> 22:02.960
this isn't about universal ideals so don't let the people pushing this fascist shit on

22:02.960 --> 22:07.920
the right tell you it's about universal morals and principles it therefore has a form correlated

22:07.920 --> 22:13.900
to contingencies of time and space in other words that the means justify the ends the

22:13.900 --> 22:17.940
ends being that these people get to have power and repel their enemies the means justify

22:17.940 --> 22:25.440
the ends says but it also has an ideal content it's idealist just like communism communism

22:25.440 --> 22:32.680
is the it's like the the the the i'm picturing like a cell doing a cell division like from

22:32.680 --> 22:40.340
biology slides or whatever it's like or or like saturn disgorging like having a birth

22:40.340 --> 22:47.600
out of its own side or whatever from myth from mythology it's communism is giving birth

22:47.600 --> 22:52.320
to this bastard child called fascism it's the same thing same in kind but different

22:52.320 --> 22:57.300
in degree mussolini says it also has an ideal content which makes it an expression of truth

22:57.300 --> 23:05.440
in the higher region of the history of thought that's exactly the same thing that we hear

23:05.440 --> 23:10.320
from the communists okay i'm not saying that fascism communism were the same by the way

23:10.320 --> 23:16.480
they're not they're not fascism is actually the degenerate child of communism as degenerate

23:16.480 --> 23:22.980
as communism is pretending to be virtuous it's wearing the false mantle of virtue in

23:22.980 --> 23:27.260
the sense of being like almost an anti-christ but here we have a footnote actually there

23:27.260 --> 23:32.480
are a couple but i've skipped some and this is mussolini message for the year first of

23:32.480 --> 23:43.080
october message for the year one october 27 1930 that he gave in milan he said today

23:43.080 --> 23:49.780
i hold that fascism as an idea a doctrine a realization is universal it is italian in

23:49.780 --> 23:55.420
its particular institutions but it is universal in the spirit nor could it be otherwise yet

23:55.420 --> 24:00.360
again you see the child of the communist thinking they have the one universal science of how

24:00.360 --> 24:06.520
all humans relations actually work it is universal to everybody but it arises in particulars

24:06.520 --> 24:11.680
and the particulars are held in opposition to the universal and we see how the how the

24:11.680 --> 24:16.000
particulars are actually just a part of a greater whole blah blah blah it's the same

24:16.000 --> 24:22.520
model and of course it's also like mystically inevitable because it is universal in the

24:22.520 --> 24:28.960
spirit nor could it be otherwise the spirit is universal by reason of its nature therefore

24:28.960 --> 24:34.140
anyone may foresee a fascist europe drawing inspiration for her institutions from the

24:34.140 --> 24:40.080
doctrine and practice of fascism europe in other words giving a fascist turned solution

24:40.080 --> 24:45.200
of problems which beset the modern state the 20th century state which is very different

24:45.200 --> 24:50.600
from the states existing before 1789 by the way i did some legwork to make sure because

24:50.600 --> 24:55.560
two things happened in 1789 we have the american constitution but we also have the beginning

24:55.560 --> 25:00.560
of the french revolution he's talking about the french revolution french revolution is

25:00.560 --> 25:08.160
in the dialectical space as well turns out that that's the model of esoteric tyranny

25:08.160 --> 25:17.080
that has plagued mankind since 1789 and really before posing as though it's some kind of

25:17.080 --> 25:22.680
liberal advancement in in society which it is not it says and the states formed immediately

25:22.680 --> 25:28.360
after the french revolution today fascism fills universal requirements fascism solves

25:28.360 --> 25:34.240
the threefold problem of relations between state and individual between state and associations

25:34.240 --> 25:42.840
between associations and organized associations so that's that's a footnote remark there about

25:42.840 --> 25:49.600
what fascism is and to put the point on the fact that it has ideal content which makes

25:49.600 --> 25:53.760
it an expression of truth in the higher region of the history of thought as mussolini had

25:53.760 --> 25:59.040
it continuing with mussolini's doctrine there is no way of exercising a spiritual influence

25:59.040 --> 26:04.280
in the world as a human will dominating the will of others unless one has a conception

26:04.280 --> 26:10.360
of both the transient and the specific reality on which that action is to be exercised and

26:10.360 --> 26:16.280
of the permanent and universal reality in which the transient dwells and has its being

26:16.280 --> 26:24.700
so yet again we're seeing this idealism permeating the entire story but the point now is exercising

26:24.700 --> 26:30.740
a spiritual influence on them in the world as a human will dominating the will of others

26:30.740 --> 26:39.200
so what the the whole point is literally a will to power for fascism it's throwing off

26:39.200 --> 26:44.280
the pretenses of liberation so what you have is with communism that's obviously it's got

26:44.280 --> 26:48.960
a pretense to liberation but it obviously wants to remind people who they really are as socialists

26:48.960 --> 26:53.700
fascism is like no no no no we're not going to do that we're not no more pretenses of liberation

26:53.700 --> 26:57.680
what we're actually going to do is we're going to dominate the will of others because we understand

26:57.680 --> 27:02.240
better it's very clearly saying that exercising spiritual influence in the world is a human will

27:02.240 --> 27:06.880
dominating the will of others and to do that you have to have a conception both of the transient

27:06.880 --> 27:12.440
and the specific reality on which the action is to be exercised and of the permanent and universal

27:12.440 --> 27:16.760
reality in which the transient dwells and has its being which they of course believe they know and

27:16.760 --> 27:21.520
nobody else knows so that's why they have to have this complete dominating authoritarian power in

27:21.520 --> 27:29.000
fact totalitarian power as we'll hear to know men Mussolini tells us one must know man and to know

27:29.000 --> 27:33.920
man one must be acquainted with reality and its laws so of course they know these better than

27:33.920 --> 27:38.760
everybody this is what you hear from our stupid right right now as well there can be no conception

27:38.760 --> 27:44.560
of the state which is not fundamentally a conception of life philosophy or intuition

27:44.560 --> 27:51.200
system of ideas evolving within the framework of logic or concentrated in a vision or a faith but

27:51.200 --> 27:58.720
always at least potentially an organic conception of the world he then goes on to explain that in

27:58.720 --> 28:05.360
fact fascism is based on a spiritual view of life it is a religion and the god of that religion is

28:05.360 --> 28:09.880
the state I mentioned earlier I never finished the thought because here we are it's me how are

28:09.880 --> 28:20.720
you doing happy new year that that where communism sees the state as in the position of Christ in the

28:20.720 --> 28:25.720
Christian Trinity what I think we're gonna hear is that fascism sees the position of the state in

28:25.720 --> 28:31.160
the position of God the Father so it's not the self-sacrificial son the fascist state has no

28:31.200 --> 28:38.800
intention whatsoever of sacrificing itself it is going to rule eternally and it holds itself up

28:38.800 --> 28:44.000
more in the position of the father than the son and so it is a perversion an inversion of the

28:44.000 --> 28:51.400
holiness of God posing as you know supreme holiness obviously and so it's a spiritual view of life

28:51.400 --> 28:56.360
here's what what Mussolini has to say about it thus many of the practical expressions of fascism

28:56.360 --> 29:01.520
such as party organization system of education and discipline can only be understood when

29:01.520 --> 29:07.680
considered in relation to its general attitude toward life which is a spiritual attitude and in

29:07.680 --> 29:16.520
a footnote which quotes a number of different speeches that he gave in 1930 and 1926 looks

29:16.520 --> 29:24.600
like in 1929 all of which seemed to have taken place in Milan I'll read these three quotes the

29:24.600 --> 29:29.480
political process is flanked by a philosophic process if it be true that matter was on the

29:29.480 --> 29:35.600
altars for one century today it is the spirit which takes its place all manifestations peculiar

29:35.600 --> 29:40.360
to the democratic spirit are consequently repudiated easygoing this improvisation the

29:40.360 --> 29:45.320
lack of a personal sense of responsibility the exaltation of numbers and of that mysterious

29:45.320 --> 29:52.800
divinity called the people all creations of the spirit starting with that religious I'm assuming

29:52.800 --> 29:59.240
with the religious are coming to the fore and nobody dare keep up the attitude of anti-clerical

29:59.240 --> 30:04.680
ism which for several decades was a favorite with democracy in the Western world by saying

30:04.680 --> 30:10.120
that God is returning we mean that spiritual values are returning okay so what's he talking

30:10.120 --> 30:14.880
about well we can guess that he's talking about kind of the Weimar situation that everything is

30:14.880 --> 30:20.680
getting very decadent this was in 1930 through the 1920s the liberal democracy experiment was

30:20.680 --> 30:25.440
failed it turned into this decadence it turned into this mess and you have people in this kind

30:25.440 --> 30:32.520
of having this quasi mysterious divinity of the people that has a democratic will and what that

30:32.520 --> 30:37.520
has led to is a deletion of spiritual values listen to how similar this sounds to the stuff

30:37.520 --> 30:43.080
we're facing today and so now it's time for God to return through the fascists of course by saying

30:43.080 --> 30:46.520
that God is returning we mean that spiritual values are returning so with this footnote what

30:46.520 --> 30:51.400
we're seeing is the color that the fascist view of life as a spiritual attitude is in fact one

30:51.400 --> 30:55.880
where spiritual values God is returning spiritual values are returning so that sounds like it might

30:55.880 --> 31:01.760
be okay except what we're also going to discover is that for the fascists state the state itself

31:01.760 --> 31:10.840
is God not not some transcendent deity that it nods to in order to cover itself it's again it's

31:10.840 --> 31:17.560
an inversion of genuine religion and in 1927 there's another quote in this footnote it's

31:17.560 --> 31:22.400
multiple quotes in one footnote he says there's a field reserved more to meditation upon the

31:22.400 --> 31:28.880
supreme ends of life than to a research upon these ends consequently science starts from experience

31:28.880 --> 31:34.040
but breaks out fatally into philosophy and in my opinion philosophy alone can enlighten science and

31:34.040 --> 31:39.200
lead to the universal idea so we're here again talking about what is the universal idea this is

31:39.200 --> 31:43.320
the Gnostic conception that these platonic thinkers can somehow figure out what the true

31:43.320 --> 31:48.440
universal idea is and then use not just science but science has to transform into philosophy but

31:48.440 --> 31:53.440
no no no no no no no that's not right philosophy alone can enlighten science and lead to the

31:53.440 --> 31:58.720
universal idea in other words just like with communism they have the idea that they actually

31:58.720 --> 32:04.680
understand the true nature of reality and that science has to bend to their true understanding

32:04.680 --> 32:10.320
of reality it gets the whole relationship upside down in exactly the same way as Plato in fact

32:10.320 --> 32:16.700
what you see with fascism is an attempt to recover the the Platonic Republic from the

32:16.700 --> 32:23.480
Marxist inversion of the Platonic Republic Marxists want to create the Platonic Republic upside down

32:23.480 --> 32:29.680
with them in charge and the hoi polloi elevates the top to fall to the bottom and be ruled over

32:29.840 --> 32:36.160
the fascists are just just doing away with the pretense and they're saying now it's all that's

32:36.160 --> 32:41.520
you can't turn the the pyramid of society upside down it's just going to collapse and so that's not

32:41.520 --> 32:45.160
going to work and so what we're going to do is we're going to recover the platonic view and so

32:45.160 --> 32:50.480
we as the philosopher kings can alone enlighten science in other words tell the science what the

32:50.480 --> 32:55.440
right answers to the science are kind of like with kovat or with their spiritual values or

32:55.440 --> 33:00.680
whatever in order for us to approach the universal idea which they believe that they have an inkling

33:00.680 --> 33:04.880
of that nobody else gets to have so they get to rule with an iron fist in a totalitarian state

33:04.880 --> 33:11.480
speaking in 29 Mussolini added in order to understand the fascist movement one must first

33:11.480 --> 33:16.720
appreciate the underlying spiritual phenomenon in all its vastness and depth see they are the true

33:16.720 --> 33:22.040
spiritualists here the manifestations of the movement have been a power of a powerful and

33:22.040 --> 33:27.520
decisive nature but one should go further in point of fact Italian fascism has not only been

33:27.520 --> 33:32.240
a political revolt against weak and incapable governments who had allowed state authority to

33:32.240 --> 33:37.200
decay and were threatening to arrest the progress of the country but also a spiritual revolt against

33:37.200 --> 33:43.080
old ideas which had corrupted the sacred principles of religion of faith of country fascism therefore

33:43.080 --> 33:50.480
has been a revolt of the people does this not a sound like what's happening today on the so-called

33:50.720 --> 33:56.960
new right or dissident right but also be a lot like communism it is in fact it's a spiritual

33:56.960 --> 34:02.080
revolt against old ideas that had corrupted we need new ideas the fascist ideas and those

34:02.080 --> 34:08.400
fascist ideas are gonna be based off of a idol built out of religion faith and country in fact

34:08.400 --> 34:13.840
that's what fascism does it holds up instead of it claims that it's that's centered on God but

34:13.840 --> 34:18.560
it's centered on the state which is holds up the sacred principles of religion of faith and of

34:18.560 --> 34:22.520
country but really what it does is it constructs an idol out of these things and forces people to

34:22.520 --> 34:30.480
worship it so those that footnote aside Mussolini explains fascism sees in the world not just those

34:30.480 --> 34:37.200
superficial material aspects in which man appears as an individual yet again same and kind different

34:37.200 --> 34:42.360
in degree from communism man appears as an individual he's not really one standing by

34:42.360 --> 34:47.920
himself self-centered subject to natural law which instinctively urges him toward a life of selfish

34:48.000 --> 34:53.520
momentary pleasure oh my god that's exactly what the dissident right says all the time now classical

34:53.520 --> 35:00.240
liberalism atomizes people it leads them to be self-centered subject to natural law but ignoring

35:00.240 --> 35:04.720
it so he's instinctively urged towards selfish momentary pleasure what do you how many more

35:04.720 --> 35:09.200
fucking times do i have to hear Jordan Peterson say he didn't stick something he doesn't he

35:10.720 --> 35:17.600
shut up jesus christ it sees not only the individual but the nation and the country

35:18.880 --> 35:25.200
individuals and generations bound together by a moral law with common traditions and a mission

35:25.200 --> 35:30.960
which suppressing the instinct for life closed in a brief circle of pleasure builds up a higher life

35:31.520 --> 35:37.520
founded on duty a life free from the limitations of time and space in which the individual by

35:37.520 --> 35:43.600
self-sacrifice the renunciation of self-interest by death itself can achieve that purely spiritual

35:43.600 --> 35:52.080
existence in which his value as a man consists so fascism is that you get to build up a higher life

35:52.080 --> 35:56.400
around what death itself it's a fucking death cult i don't know how many times we have to

35:56.400 --> 36:00.960
point these things out why because it's the bastard child of communism it is the same in

36:00.960 --> 36:05.600
kind but different in degree of course it's another death cult but through self-sacrifice

36:05.600 --> 36:10.320
and the renunciation of self-interest in other words you have to break your own will and give

36:10.320 --> 36:15.680
it over to the higher will which is incorporated literally that's the word for it here by the way

36:15.680 --> 36:22.800
corporate incorporated in the fascist state which is held up as a kind of idol idol or god to be

36:22.800 --> 36:29.520
worshipped he says this concept is therefore a spiritual one concept of fascism arising from

36:29.520 --> 36:35.360
the general reaction of the century against the materialistic positivism of the 19th century

36:36.320 --> 36:41.040
so there's where we're seeing the Weimar phenomenon everything got materialistic it got

36:41.040 --> 36:47.840
decadent and we're gonna get very austere now anti-positivistic but positive neither skeptical

36:47.840 --> 36:56.160
nor agnostic hmm neither pessimistic nor supinely optimistic as are generally speaking the doctrines

36:56.160 --> 37:01.920
all negative which place the center of life outside man oh it's a man-centered religion

37:02.720 --> 37:09.200
whereas by the exercise of his free will man can and must create his own world just like in

37:09.200 --> 37:16.240
communism man becomes his own creator the creator of his own world this is i guess if we're gonna

37:16.240 --> 37:22.720
just stick with that term idolatry this is same in kind different in degree from fascism or from

37:22.720 --> 37:27.840
communism so fascism is the negation or antithesis of communism which means that

37:27.920 --> 37:34.000
dialectically speaking the goal is going to be to let them clash in violent collision so that

37:34.000 --> 37:39.440
you can pick up the pieces and synthesize them into a greater whole which is a totalitarian

37:39.440 --> 37:47.040
system that works see fascism can produce and it has the discipline of the people and a

37:47.040 --> 37:55.200
distributist model however it's very unfair so you need an equity and sustainability-minded approach

37:55.200 --> 38:01.120
that's brought in from the other side from the communistic side the degrowth side the you know

38:01.120 --> 38:07.120
the equity and inclusion model this is this they're going to be synthesized so when we bend

38:07.120 --> 38:11.680
when we see a fascist or sorry when we see a communist provocation and we see a fascist

38:11.680 --> 38:16.800
reaction you can damn well bet that the goal is that they have the same overarching system in

38:16.800 --> 38:22.160
place and those are going to eventually be mixed and so we sell out our freedom we throw away our

38:22.160 --> 38:28.160
liberty in the name of trying to gain security against this provocation the communist provocation

38:28.160 --> 38:34.880
and when we do what we actually do is set the stage for the bastard child of communism to

38:34.880 --> 38:41.200
come into power and then mate with communism itself and create a bastard grandchild which is

38:41.760 --> 38:45.680
the system that they want to install which is ultimately this distributive system where they

38:45.680 --> 38:51.120
get to decide who gets what and who does what work that's what he's talking about and man must

38:51.120 --> 38:57.040
create his own world that's at the center of the fascist idolatry fascism he says this is

38:57.040 --> 39:02.720
Mussolini again fascism wants man to be active and to engage in action with all his energies

39:03.280 --> 39:08.400
it wants him to be manfully aware of the difficulties besetting him and ready to face them

39:09.520 --> 39:17.760
so in our time we see this huge destruction of masculinity and so the fascist rhetoric fits

39:17.760 --> 39:23.760
right into that will it fit right into it back then too fascism conceives of life as a struggle

39:23.760 --> 39:29.200
in which it behooves a man to win for himself a really worthy place first of all by fitting himself

39:29.200 --> 39:35.600
physically morally and intellectually to become the implement required for winning it so we're

39:35.600 --> 39:40.080
not going to fight through class identification as in communism we're going to fight through becoming

39:40.640 --> 39:48.320
a super soldier basically and fitting into a soldier unit which actually is given later in

39:48.320 --> 39:54.400
this description so just like communism but different it doesn't see the life in terms of

39:54.400 --> 40:00.640
class struggle it sees life in terms of intrinsic struggle so those who can rise to the top the best

40:01.760 --> 40:07.760
deserve to be on top so as i've said before where communism says oppression is the problem and we

40:07.760 --> 40:14.000
alone can end it fascism says no no actually oppression is how we got good and we should do

40:14.000 --> 40:19.840
a lot more of it as for the individual it says so for the nation this is mussolini as for the

40:19.840 --> 40:26.720
individual so for the nation and so for mankind hence the high value of culture in all its forms

40:26.720 --> 40:32.240
artistic religious scientific this is one of the reasons i'm really uncomfortable with these

40:32.240 --> 40:37.760
accounts these propaganda accounts on social media posing like look at what high culture

40:37.760 --> 40:43.920
could be again it's creating this vision of a romantic vision of the past that inspires this

40:43.920 --> 40:49.920
fascistic mindset and the outstanding importance of education well we all know what actually the

40:49.920 --> 40:54.880
fascist did with education was that they used the prussian schooling model to create um

40:55.760 --> 41:02.400
little automatons uh not that much differently from what mao did and what the soviets did

41:03.760 --> 41:10.320
so that's not that good hence also the essential value of work by which man subjugates nature and

41:10.320 --> 41:15.840
creates the human world economic political ethical and intellectual again we see same

41:15.840 --> 41:22.640
and kind different and degree from uh communism and we see reflections of exactly what the so

41:23.280 --> 41:27.920
called new right thinks is a great idea now we really need to be thinking more carefully about

41:27.920 --> 41:33.600
what we're dealing with and our responses to the circumstances that were put in through this huge

41:33.600 --> 41:39.840
global communist provocation we're facing right now so there are a couple footnotes this one is

41:40.480 --> 41:46.000
headed as the positive conception of life as struggle so fascism holds a positive conception

41:46.000 --> 41:52.800
of life as struggle and here's what mussolini had to say on that topic um in 1920 um in this

41:52.800 --> 42:00.000
case in trieste and he said struggle is at the origin of all things for life is full of contrasts

42:00.000 --> 42:05.760
there is love and hatred white and black day and night good and evil and until these contrasts

42:05.760 --> 42:12.320
achieve balance struggle faithfully remains at the root of human nature so this is ultimately the

42:12.320 --> 42:18.480
hermetic polarity model that just like communism uses the idea is that there's these contrasts

42:18.480 --> 42:22.800
there's distinctions and they are in conflict with one another struggle between them

42:25.520 --> 42:32.160
however he says it is good for it to be so so this is where i said that fascism doesn't say

42:32.160 --> 42:35.920
that these things are bad and should be transcended it says no these things are good and should be

42:35.920 --> 42:42.240
elevated today we can indulge in wars economic battles conflicts of ideas but if a day came

42:42.240 --> 42:47.920
to pass when struggle ceased to exist that day would be tinged with melancholy it would be a day

42:47.920 --> 42:55.760
of ruin the day of ending but that ever discloses new horizons by attempting to restore calm peace

42:55.760 --> 43:02.400
tranquility or a would-be fighting the tendencies of the sorry or a would-be fighting the tendencies

43:02.400 --> 43:08.560
of the present period of dynamism or we must prepare be prepared for other struggles and for

43:08.560 --> 43:14.560
other surprises peace will only come when people surrender to a christian dream of universal

43:14.560 --> 43:21.920
brotherhood when they can hold out hands across the ocean and over the mountains and then that

43:21.920 --> 43:25.920
sounds really great because it's nodding toward christianity and then what does mussolini say

43:25.920 --> 43:32.160
personally i do not believe very much in these idealisms but i do not exclude them for i exclude

43:32.160 --> 43:38.400
nothing so he doesn't really believe in it but we'll hold it up as an emblem because he's building

43:38.640 --> 43:45.120
an idol in the state he goes on in his doctrine to explain this positive conception of life is

43:45.120 --> 43:50.960
obviously an ethical one it invests the whole field of reality as well as the human activities

43:50.960 --> 43:57.360
which master it no action is exempt from moral judgment no activity can be despoiled of the value

43:57.360 --> 44:02.640
which a moral purpose confers on all things therefore life conceived of by the fascist

44:03.280 --> 44:09.040
is serious austere and religious that's what the new right seems to think we all want to

44:09.040 --> 44:12.960
have even though we also all know that they're kind of decadent behind the scenes and complete

44:12.960 --> 44:19.680
jerks all its manifestations are poised in a world sustained by moral forces and subject

44:19.680 --> 44:26.400
to spiritual responsibilities the fascist disdains an easy life so that's again

44:27.360 --> 44:35.280
kind of this same in kind different degree from communism it's actually the picture of throwing

44:35.280 --> 44:39.040
off the illusion of communism so communism has this illusion that we're all going to have a life

44:39.040 --> 44:43.680
of liberated leisure fascism's like no no no we're not we're going to all work and miserable toil

44:43.680 --> 44:48.240
forever and in lots of conflict and struggle there will never be harmony and if there was

44:48.240 --> 44:55.600
we'd be sad about it now there's a footnote here that's headed fascism's ethical conception

44:55.600 --> 45:01.920
and he says i called the organization fasci italiani de combatimento this hard metallic

45:01.920 --> 45:08.400
name comprised the whole program of fascism as i dreamed it now listen to how he addresses his

45:08.400 --> 45:16.880
people this is him in 1932 in a talk titled we're against easy life okay so i'm gonna read some of

45:16.880 --> 45:23.680
that part again this is this hard metallic name fasci italiani de combatimento this hard metallic

45:23.680 --> 45:29.920
name comprised the whole program of fascism as i dreamed it and then he says comrades comrades

45:32.000 --> 45:41.920
comrades this is still our program fight life for the fascist is a continuous ceaseless fight

45:41.920 --> 45:48.160
which we accept with ease with great courage with the necessary intrepidity

45:48.160 --> 45:56.400
you touch the core of fascist philosophy he says when a recent when recently a finnish

45:56.400 --> 46:01.040
philosopher asked me to expound to him the significance of fascism in one sentence i wrote

46:01.600 --> 46:10.560
in german we are against the easy life in his doctrine he writes the fascist conception of

46:10.560 --> 46:17.200
life is a religious one in which man is viewed in his imminent relation to a higher law

46:17.840 --> 46:22.960
endowed with an objective will transcending the individual and raising him to conscious

46:22.960 --> 46:29.840
membership of a spiritual society those who perceive nothing beyond opportunistic

46:29.840 --> 46:35.680
considerations in the religious policy of the fascist regime fail to realize that fascism is

46:35.680 --> 46:42.880
not only a system of government but also and above all a system of thought and the footnote

46:42.880 --> 46:49.040
on the religious conception of fascism quotes again from milan mussolini saying in 1930

46:49.040 --> 46:54.320
if fascism were not a creed how could it endow its followers with courage and stoicism

46:55.040 --> 47:00.240
only a creed which has soared to the heights of religion can inspire such words as past the lips

47:00.240 --> 47:09.360
now lifeless alas of frederico florio it's a religion fascism is a religion a religion of

47:09.360 --> 47:15.520
what well it's a religion of the fascist state as it turns out based on the idea of conflict

47:15.520 --> 47:23.040
and a positive conception of itself through constant ceaseless struggle austerity severity

47:24.080 --> 47:28.240
i wonder why it doesn't work in the end wonder why people get so dissatisfied and get so upset

47:28.240 --> 47:32.320
with it and then you end up handing over all the authority to the left fascism is not an

47:32.320 --> 47:37.600
answer to communism it is the next stage of stalled communism on its way to the true

47:37.600 --> 47:44.000
implementation of communism when communism stalls fascism arises when fascism arises

47:45.520 --> 47:52.240
it sets the preconditions necessary to move into the new form of actually existing socialism and

47:52.240 --> 47:57.120
we see this again and again through history it is not an answer even though it speaks

47:58.320 --> 48:02.800
in an idolatrous way toward what look like important pieces of the answer for example

48:02.800 --> 48:08.640
the next section of this document is titled the importance of tradition yes in fact tradition is

48:08.640 --> 48:15.600
important yes in fact communists destroy tradition yes in fact that is a positive direction to point

48:15.600 --> 48:20.480
to to pay attention to because tradition is in fact an ex a kind of codification of experiments

48:20.480 --> 48:27.680
upon what has worked in the past which is valuable however we're going to turn it into

48:27.680 --> 48:35.200
an idol if we're fascists what does Mussolini say in the fascist conception of history man is man

48:35.200 --> 48:40.480
only by virtue of the spiritual process to which he contributes as a member of the family the

48:40.480 --> 48:46.800
social group the nation and in function of history to which all nations bring their contribution

48:47.440 --> 48:53.520
hence the great value of tradition and records and language and customs in the rules of social life

48:53.520 --> 49:03.200
outside history man is a non-entity that's what that's what he had to say that's what Mussolini

49:03.200 --> 49:08.800
had to say about tradition that's it there's a footnote here where we get a quote from his

49:08.800 --> 49:14.080
speech in Milan from 1930 again tradition certainly is one of the greatest spiritual

49:14.080 --> 49:18.960
forces of a people in as much as it is successive and constant creation of their soul

49:19.440 --> 49:24.160
so that's on the historical and realistic conception allegedly of fascism as compared

49:24.160 --> 49:29.920
to other doctrines so i just want to kind of go back to that part though outside history

49:29.920 --> 49:36.480
man is a non-entity but fascism has the same view of history roughly that communism has which is

49:36.480 --> 49:42.960
that history is this kind of productive capacity of man and creating and telling his own story

49:42.960 --> 49:50.800
and only within that are you even an entity so your role is to contribute to what to the

49:50.800 --> 49:55.760
grand movement of history which is exactly what the class conflict in communism is about

49:55.760 --> 50:01.840
except this is different because it's a rejection of that in in the dialectical way in communism

50:01.840 --> 50:06.880
the classes are to awaken to a class consciousness to realize that they are historical movers and

50:06.880 --> 50:13.440
take part in their contribution to the movement of history toward an arc of liberation in fascism

50:13.440 --> 50:21.040
you are to awaken to your consciousness as a member of the bound together unified state and

50:21.040 --> 50:25.840
make your contribution toward the bending of history toward whatever the hell the fascist

50:25.840 --> 50:30.800
think lies at the end of it which is not exactly clear because it seems to be relentlessly fighting

50:30.800 --> 50:37.440
uh it's actually imperialism i think if we get further down so the next section is titled

50:37.440 --> 50:43.840
rejection of individualism and the importance of the state and i should add just uh parenthetically

50:43.840 --> 50:51.040
that the subject headings here were added by the curators of this website not by Mussolini so he

50:51.040 --> 50:55.680
didn't he just wrote the doctrine this subject heading rejection of individualism and the

50:55.680 --> 51:00.400
importance of the state is the summary of this next section and what Mussolini had to say about

51:00.400 --> 51:05.440
it is fascism is therefore opposed to all individualistic abstractions based on 18th

51:05.440 --> 51:11.840
century century materialism it is opposed to all Jacobinistic utopias and innovations so it's

51:11.840 --> 51:18.640
against liberalism and it's against uh communism Jacobins are the precursors really to the communist

51:18.640 --> 51:22.880
so we can just say that that's roughly the same thing that's the french social contract idea

51:23.680 --> 51:28.160
it does not believe in the possibility of happiness on earth as conceived by the

51:28.160 --> 51:33.840
economist literature of the 18th century in other words Thomas Jefferson's idea of life

51:33.840 --> 51:40.240
liberty and the pursuit of happiness and uh John Locke's conceptions of pursuing happiness and many

51:40.240 --> 51:47.280
of the uh English enlightenment's views of the value of pursuing a life worth living those are

51:47.280 --> 51:53.600
out in fascism it rejects that it does not believe in the possibility of happiness or even the smiles

51:53.600 --> 51:59.760
of heaven as it was sometimes phrased on earth as conceived by the economistic literature of

51:59.760 --> 52:04.400
the 19th century and it therefore rejects the theological notion that at some future time the

52:04.400 --> 52:10.800
human family will secure a final settlement of all its difficulties in fascism war is forever

52:11.360 --> 52:16.880
this notion runs over sorry this notion runs counter to experience which teaches that life

52:16.880 --> 52:23.760
is in continual flux and is uh sorry is in continual flux and in process of evolution

52:24.320 --> 52:31.040
in politics fascism aims at realism in practice it desires to deal only with those problems

52:31.040 --> 52:37.520
which are the spontaneous product of historic conditions and which find or suggest their own

52:37.520 --> 52:44.400
solutions so i urge you once again to realize that fascism is not a solution to communism it is the

52:44.400 --> 52:52.480
same thing same in kind different in degree they are two branches of the same tree the footnote

52:52.480 --> 52:59.120
here reads uh here quoting several uh different uh pieces from it looks like another speech he

52:59.120 --> 53:05.600
gave in Milan in 1930 our temperament leads us to appraise the concrete aspect of problems rather

53:05.600 --> 53:11.600
than their ideological or mystical sublimation therefore we easily regain our balance our battle

53:11.600 --> 53:18.000
is an ungrateful one yet it is a beautiful battle since it compels us to count only upon our own

53:18.000 --> 53:25.040
forces revealed truths have torn to sorry revealed truths we have torn to shreds so much for your

53:25.040 --> 53:31.920
religion i guess dogmas we have spat upon we have rejected all theories of paradise we have baffled

53:31.920 --> 53:38.240
charlatans white red black charlatans who placed miraculous drugs on the market to give a happiness

53:38.880 --> 53:46.160
to mankind we do not believe in program and plans and saints or apostles above all we believe not in

53:46.160 --> 53:52.800
happiness in salvation or in the promised land we do not believe in a single solution be it

53:52.800 --> 53:58.880
economical political or moral a linear solution of the problems of life because of illustrate

53:58.880 --> 54:05.200
illustrious choristers from all of the sacri i don't think that this is a real word

54:05.200 --> 54:12.400
sacristies that's got to be a mistype sorry because of the elusive choristers because of

54:12.400 --> 54:18.480
illustrious choristers from all the sacristies life is not linear and never can be reduced to

54:18.480 --> 54:26.240
a segment traced by primordial needs only by entering into the process of reality this is back

54:26.240 --> 54:30.480
in the doctrine by the way one sentence and another footnote from milan only by entering

54:30.480 --> 54:34.800
into the process of reality and taking possession of the forces at work within it can man act on

54:34.800 --> 54:41.920
nature sorry can man act on man and on nature i really butchered a very important sentence

54:41.920 --> 54:46.000
let me read the whole sentence again after reminding you that that's what mark said the

54:46.000 --> 54:51.600
point of man's act life activity is is to work on man and nature to bring out his true nature

54:51.600 --> 54:56.400
so for the communist it is that you are a socialist that is going to live in perfect

54:56.400 --> 55:00.560
harmony in your perfectly creative environment for the fascist is that you are going to be

55:01.200 --> 55:08.480
a socialist who works in perfect harmony with the state apparatus that actually makes socialism work

55:09.760 --> 55:16.960
oh but he says only by entering into the process of reality just like communism and taking

55:16.960 --> 55:20.720
possession of the forces at work within it we don't call that seizing the means of production

55:20.720 --> 55:26.800
here i guess can man act on man and on nature that's exactly the same program as communism with

55:26.880 --> 55:31.040
different ends same in kind different in degree it's a dialectical antithesis

55:31.040 --> 55:36.240
of communism and therefore it is meant to synthesize or blend with communism into one

55:36.240 --> 55:42.480
coherent system on the other side of the reaction after a tremendous conflict we should not be

55:42.480 --> 55:46.800
supporting this and we should not be supporting people who are supporting this the footnote here

55:46.800 --> 55:52.400
to that particularly interesting very communistic sentence is we are not and do not wish to be

55:52.400 --> 55:57.840
motionless mummies with faces perpetually turned toward the same horizon nor do we wish to shut

55:57.840 --> 56:02.400
ourselves up within the narrow hedges of subversive bigotry where formulas like

56:02.400 --> 56:08.000
prayer of a professed religion are muttered mechanically we are men living men who wish

56:08.000 --> 56:14.160
to give our contribution however modest to the creation of history we uphold moral and

56:14.160 --> 56:20.880
traditional values which socialism neglects or despises but above all fascism has a horror

56:20.880 --> 56:27.520
of anything implying an arbitrary mortgage on the mysterious future in spite of the theories

56:27.520 --> 56:32.560
of conservation and renovation of tradition and progress expounded by the right and the left

56:32.560 --> 56:39.120
we do not cling desperately to the past as as to a last board of salvation yet we do not dash

56:39.120 --> 56:46.320
headlong into the seductive mists of the future negation eternal immobility mean damnation

56:46.320 --> 56:54.320
i am all for motion i am one who marches on this is fascism so in his doctrine he goes on

56:54.320 --> 56:59.360
again a short piece before another footnote anti-individualistic the fascist conception of

56:59.360 --> 57:04.640
life stresses the importance of the state see it's holding up the state as a religious idol

57:04.640 --> 57:09.680
it is anti-individualistic your goal is not to merge with the class as in communism it is to

57:09.680 --> 57:19.040
merge with the state overall which is ultimately what happens at the end of communism and then the

57:19.040 --> 57:24.400
state goes away and communism but the state persists so the self-sacrificial christ state

57:24.400 --> 57:31.040
and communism is replaced by the eternally enduring god the father state in fascism

57:31.040 --> 57:37.200
it's just another idol though anti-individualistic so you aren't you you're just part of the state

57:37.200 --> 57:41.520
the fascist conception of life stresses the importance of the state and accepts the individual

57:42.080 --> 57:47.680
only insofar as his interests coincide with those of the state which stands for the conscience and

57:47.680 --> 57:55.360
the universal will of man as a historic entity so the state is your conscience the state is your

57:55.360 --> 58:03.760
universal state of being that is what you must remember you are you are a part of a cog within

58:03.760 --> 58:11.280
the fascist state and your individuality is not welcome we must not support the people

58:11.280 --> 58:17.120
supporting fascism as though it's a solution to the problems america face faces it is to throw

58:17.120 --> 58:24.000
america away in order to try to save america the footnote here is headed the individual and liberty

58:24.960 --> 58:32.080
and here we have a conference in milan that's being quoted from 1929 we were the first to

58:32.080 --> 58:38.960
state in the face of demo liberal individualism that the individual exists only insofar as he is

58:38.960 --> 58:45.280
within the state and subjected to the requirements of the state and that as civilization assumes

58:45.280 --> 58:50.240
aspects which grow more and more complicated individual freedoms becomes more and more

58:50.240 --> 58:58.560
restricted exactly the same model he says that we're not going to reject 1789 meaning the french

58:58.560 --> 59:03.520
revolution of course he doesn't want to reject russo's social contract program this is exactly

59:03.520 --> 59:07.840
what he's articulating individual freedom becomes more and more restricted we could quote from

59:07.840 --> 59:13.200
max horkheimer explaining that freedom and justice are dialectical concepts the more of one you have

59:13.200 --> 59:22.400
the less of the other oh same thing here so the individual exists only insofar as he is within

59:22.400 --> 59:26.800
the state so the human's true nature that the fascist understands in a gnostic way is that

59:26.800 --> 59:31.680
you are a cog within the state and so you must be subjected to the requirements of that state

59:33.120 --> 59:37.760
and as the civilization assumes aspects which grow more and more complicated think of how

59:37.760 --> 59:43.440
complicated life is now individual freedom becomes more and more restricted this is exactly the shit

59:43.440 --> 59:48.560
we hear from the world economic forum all the time by the way and this is what we hear from the tradd

59:48.560 --> 59:53.280
right this new right or dissident right or whatever where they want to start restricting

59:53.280 --> 59:57.280
more and more freedom because people are doing it wrong and we can't possibly have freedom because

59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.600
freedom leads to atomization and conflict and blah blah blah and that's what really gave rise

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.920
to communism in the first place which is not true what we're seeing is the same in kind but

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:13.280
different in degree it is the reaction to communism but he goes on here in his speech 29 29 in milan

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.480
he says the state sorry the sense of the state grows within the consciousness of Italians for

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:23.680
they feel that the state alone is the irreplaceable safeguard of their unit and independence

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:31.200
that the state alone represents continuity into the future of their stock and their history sounds

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.480
very much like an idol it's like moses coming down from the mountain and they've got the golden

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:42.880
calf there but the golden calf is a state and moses calls over and says what have you done and

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.640
the guy's like i don't know we just took all the gold and we threw it in the fire and out came this

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:54.080
state that we're all a part of now it's straight idolatry now we switch to another speech in this

01:00:54.080 --> 01:01:01.520
part of the footnote from 1928 also in milan and we'll go back to the 1921 or 29 one in the next

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:07.760
part it says if in the course of the last eight years we have made such astounding progress you

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:14.480
may well think and suppose and foresee that in the course of the next 50 or 80 years the onward

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:21.360
trend of italy of this italy we feel to be so powerful so full of vital fluid yuk will be really

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:30.400
grandiose it will be so especially if concord lasts among citizens ps it didn't if the state

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:37.360
continues to be the sole arbiter arbitrator sorry in political and social conflicts if all remains

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:43.280
within the state and nothing outside the state if all remains within the state nothing outside the

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:49.440
state if all remains within god and nothing outside of god the state is an idol in fascism

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.800
because it is impossible to conceive any individual existing outside the state unless he be

01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:04.000
a savage whose home is in the solitude of the sandy desert and then coming back to 1929 a year

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.520
later he said fascism has restored to the state its sovereign functions by claiming its absolute

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:15.120
ethical meaning against the egotism of classes and categories to the government of the state

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.640
which was reduced to a mere instrument of electoral assemblies it has restored dignity

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:26.400
as representing the personality of the state and its power of empire it has rescued state

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:33.840
administration from the weight of factions and party interests so back to the doctrine the first

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.720
half of this by the way has tons of footnotes and then the second half doesn't fascism mussolini

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:44.720
tells us is opposed to classical liberalism let's be real clear about that sounds like today

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.760
fascism is opposed to classical liberalism which arose as a reaction to absolutism

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.720
and exhausted its historical function when the state became the expression of the conscience

01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:02.320
and will of the people liberalism denied the state in the name of the individual fascism reasserts

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.320
the rights of the state as expressing the real is the real essence of the individual so did you get

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:14.480
that here's the intrinsic conflict liberalism denies the state and the name of the individual

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:19.840
that's why it's actually the answer to communism that's not what fascism says fascism reasserts the

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.520
rights of the state as expressing the real essence of the individual the individual the person you

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:36.000
your true human nature is a piece of the state that's fascism and in a footnote from uh may 1929

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:41.600
in milan he says let no one think of denying the moral character of fascism i will deny the moral

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:46.720
character of fascism actually you motherfucker let no one think of denying the moral character

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:51.280
of fascism for i should be ashamed to speak from this tribune if i did not feel that i represent

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:57.360
the moral and spiritual powers of the state what would the state be if it did not possess a spirit

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:02.960
of its own and a morality of its own which lend power to the laws in virtue of which the state

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:08.720
is obeyed by its citizens the fascist state claims its ethical character it is catholic

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:16.000
but above all it is fascist it's an idol in fact it is exclusively and essentially

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.720
fascist catholicism completes fascism in this we openly declare but let no one think they can turn

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:27.200
the tables on us under cover of metaphysics or philosophy so if you think this is really about

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:31.600
your religion you are dead wrong you know the state is going to replace your religion

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:35.280
all you stupid trad caths thinking this is a good idea you need to stop

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.880
it is catholic but above all it is fascist in fact it is exclusively and essentially fascist

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.640
don't let anybody think they can turn the tables on us you're not going to

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:53.520
under the cover of metaphysics or philosophy he says that uh fascism is a state which is fully

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.720
aware of its mission and represents a people which are marching on a state which is which

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:05.600
necessarily transforms the people even in their physical aspect just like communism same and kind

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.240
different in degree in order to be something more than a mere administrator the state must utter

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:17.200
great words expound great ideas and place great problems before the people and so what does he

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.000
think of liberty in the doctrine he says and if liberty is to be the attribute of living men and

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.840
not of abstract dummies invented by individualistic liberalism then fascism stands for liberty well

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.040
there's your dialectical inversion isn't it and for the only liberty worth having having what's

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:39.280
the only liberty worth having according to benito mussolini the liberty of the state and of the

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:45.760
individual within the state so the footnote here says quoting from a speech in 1924 in milan

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:54.080
the vol sorry the concept of freedom is not absolute uh-oh just like the communists uh-oh

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.920
uh-oh freedom is a dialectical concept because nothing is ever absolute in life freedom is not

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:07.920
a right it is a duty it is not a gift it is a conquest it is not equality it is a privilege

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:13.360
privilege of what granted by the state this is a complete rejection of the idea that our rights

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:17.840
come from god and so any charlatan on the right who says that our rights come from god and then

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:25.680
advocates for fascism is a fucking liar got that they're not lying they are a fucking liar

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:35.040
got it freedom is a privilege from the deified state that's fascism the concept of freedom

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:40.240
changes with the passing of time exactly like communism there is a freedom in times of peace

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:45.280
which is not the freedom of times of war there is a freedom in times of prosperity which is not a

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:52.640
freedom to be allowed in times of poverty in our state the individual is not deprived of freedom

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:58.320
in fact he has greater liberty than an isolated man because the state protects him and he is part

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:04.400
of the state isolated man is without defense so in other words you can have a little bit of security

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:10.000
and lose your freedom and somehow that becomes greater freedom because now you're protected

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.480
yeah same scam different day the doctrine another short paragraph before another long footnote

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.760
the fascist conception of the state is all embracing outside of it no human or spiritual

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:28.640
values can exist much less have value did you get that part the fascist conception of the state is

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:38.800
all embracing it's the idol outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist outside of the state

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:46.560
no human or spiritual values can exist much less have value thus understood fascism is totalitarian

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:52.400
that's Mussolini describing his own doctrine right there black and white thus understood

01:07:52.400 --> 01:08:00.000
fascism is totalitarian and the fascist state a synthesis and unit inclusive of all values

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.040
interprets develops and potentiates the whole life of a people yet again the fascists are

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:13.440
gnostics who figured out that the state is the true nature of man and to be part of the hive

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:19.920
of the state is what you have to remember you actually are the footnote says today we may tell

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:26.160
the world of the creation of the powerful united state of italy ranging from the alps to sicily

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:31.280
this state is expressed by a well-organized centralized unitarian democracy where people

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.760
circulate at ease indeed gentlemen if you admit the people into the citadel of the state

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.280
and the people will defend it if you close them out the people will assault it in the

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:46.880
fascist regime the unity of classes the political social and choral unity of the italian people is

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:55.840
realized within the state and only within the fascist state so the doctrine comes back to say

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:00.400
no individuals or groups political parties cultural associations economic unions social

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:07.760
classes exist outside of the state this is explained further in a footnote with the heading

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.600
conception of a cooperative state he says we have created the united state of italy remember that

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:20.240
since the empire italy had not been a united state here i wish to reaffirm solemnly our doctrine of

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:26.000
the state here i wish to reaffirm affirm with no weaker energy the formula i expounded at the

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.360
skala in milan everything in the state nothing against the state nothing outside the state

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:41.600
is god outside the state no no god is in the state god is part of the state god is

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:50.000
subsidiary subsidiary to the state god is out of the picture and the idol of the state is central

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.640
stop letting these so-called religious people tell you that they're trying to bring back religious

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:01.200
and spiritual values in the guise of fascism nothing could be further from true fascism he

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:06.160
says back in the doctrine is therefore opposed to socialism to which unity within the state which

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:12.560
amalgamates sorry which amalgamates classes into a single economic and ethical reality is unknown

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:18.320
so in other words because socialism operates off of a picture of class consciousness and antagonism

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:24.160
it doesn't unify the state in one single mass so it's opposed that's the reason fascism is

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:29.680
opposed to socialism and which sees in history nothing but class struggle that's another reason

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:34.560
that it's opposed to socialism because your goal isn't to be an awakened oppressed class that wants

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.280
to overthrow the the oppressive chains of society it's to realize that you are part of the oppressive

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:44.640
state itself and that your role is to uphold the power of the oppressive state it's exactly like

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.920
i've been explaining to people for a couple of years now fascism he says is likewise opposed to

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:55.760
trade unionism as a class weapon but when brought within the orbit of the state fascism recognizes

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:01.040
the real needs that gave rise to socialism and trade unionism giving them due weight in the

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.080
guild or corporative system in which divergent interests are coordinated and harmonized

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.960
in the unity of the state and the footnote it says we are in other words a state which controls

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:17.280
all forces acting in nature we control political forces we control moral forces we control economic

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:23.520
forces therefore we are a full-blown corporative state we stand for a new principle in the world

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:30.320
we stand for sheer categorical definitive antithesis to the world of democracy plutocracy

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:36.320
freemasonry to the world which still abides by the fundamental principles laid down in 1789

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.120
which is the french revolution which is not exactly the thing to be holding up as a great

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.400
program here everything is in the state the state is your idol

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:54.640
the ministry of corporations this is back in the actual doctrine is not a bureaucratic organ nor

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:59.120
does it wish to exercise the functions of syndical organizations which are necessarily independent

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.320
since they aim at organizing selecting and improving the members of syndicates the ministry

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:10.400
of corporations is an institution in virtue of which in the center and outside integral corporation

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.880
becomes an accomplished fact where balance is achieved between interests and forces of the

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:21.120
economic world this is the Deng Xiaoping model by the way this is that you have a corporative state

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:27.920
and then there are corporations that are actually shells of that overarching state that operates in

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:33.760
a fascistic subsidiarity way so when you have a state corporation and then the real corporations

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:39.040
that do the real production act in concert with the public-private partnership stakeholder

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:45.280
capitalism CCP Deng Xiaoping model whatever one you want to pick what you have is fascism

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:50.080
you have fascist subsidiarity where the corporations do the will of the state

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.640
and you say well what's happening isn't communism now because that's what we have here it's fascism

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.720
that's what's happening in the u.s no no they fused guys they fused they're already together

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.440
they mixed that was the project of the second half of the 20th century when you try to separate

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.480
fascism and communism in the world today you're thinking about terms that haven't been relevant

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:14.240
since like the 1920s and 1930s that's all obsolete since the 1960s 1970s communism and

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.080
fascism have fused into a single system as would happen when the thesis and the antithesis are seen

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:26.000
together and finally become seen as two pieces of the same puzzle two same and kind different

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.040
in degree and are synthesized into a single thing and this is what he's describing such a glance is

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:37.040
so what the problem is here let me just explain before i go on even though i'm pushing it on my

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:45.120
time here what they realize is the fascism can produce sort of but it can't make people happy

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.680
it can't actually make the people like it's not good it doesn't work it's completely unstable

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:54.720
so what they need is a system of distribution that actually mimics the promises of communism

01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.920
and so what they did was they it's fascism for the corporate universe and it's it's uh communism for

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.400
for the people for the regular people that's the new model this program doesn't actually work it

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.160
works better than communism but it doesn't work so if you just mix them two together you could

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.160
have a totalitarian system that works if you want to know what it looks like in practice look at

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:22.000
china he says such a glance is possible only within the sphere of the state because the state

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.800
alone transcends the contrasting interests of groups and individuals not god don't let these

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.480
people fool you into thinking this is religious it's state religion it's an idol of the state

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.560
in view of coordinating them to achieve higher aims the achievement of these aims is speeded

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.560
up by the fact that all economic organizations acknowledged safeguarded and supported by the

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:51.200
corporative state exist within the orbit of fascism in other terms they accept the conception

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:58.560
of fascism in theory and in practice and it says we have constituted a corporative fascist state

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.480
to the state of national society a state which concentrates controls harmonizes and tempers the

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:11.440
interests of all social classes which are thereby protected in equal measure again safety committee

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:17.680
on public safety there's your 1789 thing that's the french revolution being at the center of

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:24.400
what's going on here whereas during the years of demo liberal regime labor looked with diffidence

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.680
upon the state was in fact outside of the state and against the state and considered the state

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:35.440
an enemy of every day in every hour there is not one working italian today who does not seek a

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.360
place in his corporation or federation who does not wish to be a living atom of the great immense

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.360
living organization which is the national corporate state of fascism imagine that life you

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.960
get to be part of the big state idol in the doctrine he writes grouped according to their

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:58.560
several interests individuals form classes these divergent interests form trade unions when

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:03.120
organized according to their several economic activities but first and foremost they form

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:11.680
the state which is no mere matter of numbers the sons of so it says sons s-u-n-s here by the way

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:18.160
i'm not sure if that's a typo the sons of the individuals forming the majority fascism is

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:23.920
therefore opposed to that form of democracy which equates a nation to the majority lowering

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:29.360
it to the level of the largest number but it is the purest form of democracy same kinds of

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:34.640
lies communism tells if the nation be considered as it should be from the point of view of quality

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:41.440
rather than quantity as an idea the mightiest because the most ethical the most coherent the

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:48.240
truest expressing itself in a people as the conscience and the will of the few if not indeed

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:54.480
of one an ending to express itself in the conscious and conscience and will of the mass

01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:00.720
of the whole group ethnically molded by natural and historical conditions into a nation advancing

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:06.400
as one conscience and one will along the same lines of development and spiritual formation

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:13.920
not a race which he notes as a 95% of feeling when he's talking about race not a race nor a

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:19.840
geographically defined region but a people historically perpetuating itself a multitude

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:26.400
unified by an idea and imbued with the will to live the will to power self-consciousness

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:35.360
and personality this is this is fascism right there so it is an ethno state held up as an idol

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.520
in which everyone has to understand themselves and there is nothing outside of it and it is the

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:47.520
basis of your of your religious existence he says in so far as it is embodied in a state this higher

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.960
personality becomes a nation it is not the nation which generates the state that is an antiquated

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:58.720
naturalistic concept which is which afforded a basis for 19th century publicity in favor of

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:04.400
national governments rather it is the state which creates the nation connected with the

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:11.280
nation conferring volition and therefore real life on a people made aware of their moral unity

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:18.560
the right to national independence does not arise from any merely literary and idealistic form of

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:24.240
self-consciousness still less from a more or less passive and unconscious de facto situation

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:29.840
but from an active self-conscious political will expressing itself in action and ready to prove

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:37.760
its rights it arises it arises in short from the existence at least in fieri of a state and d indeed

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:43.840
it is the state which has the expression of a universal ethical will creates the right to a

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:49.360
to national independence so the state is an expression of universal ethical will it's again

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:57.520
it's an idol footnote here long one on the conception of a state mussolini explains a

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.800
nation exists in as much as it is a people a people rise in as much as they are numerous

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:07.680
hard-working and well-regulated power is the outcome of this threefold principle this by the

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.680
way is the same stuff you hear from the christian nationalist people for example stephen wolf in his

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:17.600
book the case for christian nationalism fascism he says does not deny the state fascism maintains

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:24.640
that a civic society national or imperial cannot be conceived unless in the form of a state for us

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:30.320
the nation is mainly spirit and not only territory there are states which owned immense

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:35.760
territories and yet left no trace in the history of mankind neither is it a question of number

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:40.320
because there have been in history small microscopic states which left immortal

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:45.680
imperishable documents in art and philosophy the greatness of a nation is the compound of all of

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:51.600
these virtues and conditions a nation is great when the power of the spirit is translated into

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.240
reality so just like with the christian trinity that's been perverted and through hagel and

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:02.400
inverted through marks and then re-inverted in fascism you see that there's a holy spirit that is

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:08.480
flowing forth from the state that embodies the people with their will and their character

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:16.000
this is a perverse religion state as the state as an idol that's what fascism is

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:22.640
we wish to unify the nation within the sovereign state which is above everyone and can afford to

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:28.320
be against everyone since it represents the moral continuity of the nation in history

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:33.920
without the state there is no nation there are merely human aggregations subject to all the

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:40.480
disintegrations which history may inflict upon them that was him speaking in 24 by the way in

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:46.480
milan as well in the doctrine and then we get to the last footnote and we can finally just

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:51.280
tear through the rest of this he says a nation is expressed in the state as a living ethical entity

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:58.480
only in so far as it is active inactivity is death therefore the state is not only authority

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:05.040
which governs and confers legal form and spiritual value on individual wills but it is also power

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.760
which makes its will felt and respected beyond its own frontiers thus affording practical

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.240
proof of the universal character of the decisions necessary to ensure its development

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:20.560
this implies organization and expansion potential if not actual thus the state equates itself to

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:25.680
the will of man whose development cannot be checked by obstacles in which by achieving

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:32.160
self-expression demonstrates its infinity this is religious language the state is the idol of

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:39.600
fascism and so the last footnote is titled dynamic reality of fascism and it says there's a quote from

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:46.480
1926 in a speech to the senate and mussolini said i believe that if a people wish to live they

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:51.920
should develop a will to power otherwise they vegetate live miserably and become prey to a

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:58.800
stronger people in whom this will to power is developed to a higher degree well i don't know

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:05.120
about all that it seems like life might be spiritually conceived of better than as a will

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:12.320
to power which is very niche and um and not so good so the next section back the rest of this

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:17.360
is all doctrine now no more footnotes fascist state as a spiritual force the fascist state is

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:21.920
a higher and more powerful expression of personality is a force but a spiritual one

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:27.440
the fascist state is a spiritual force it sums up all the manifestations of the moral intellectual

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:32.720
life of man if function its functions therefore cannot be limited to those of enforcing order

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:38.320
and keeping the peace as the liberal doctrine had it is no mere mechanical device for defining

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:44.800
the sphere within which the individual may duly exercise his supposed rights rights his supposed

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:50.080
rights the individual may duly exercise his supposed rights the fascist state is an inwardly

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:56.320
accepted standard of rule and conduct a discipline of the whole person it permeates the will no less

01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:01.040
than the intellect it stands for a principle which becomes the central motive of man as a

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:07.680
member of civilized society sinking deep down into his personality it dwells in the heart of

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.200
the man of action and of the thinker and of the artist and of the man of science it is the soul of

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:20.000
the soul whoa hold on also there's another freaking footnote here i apologize for being

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.640
wrong about that this is heavy duty though this is so similar to the stuff that mao says like that

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:30.960
we're gonna have to in in his program you have tons of freedom but it's freedom with discipline

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.880
you have to adopt the discipline yourself which is socialist discipline there here it's fascist

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:40.000
discipline there you have to be committed to the the building of the social state here you have to

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.320
be committed to the building of the fascist state it's literally identical so what you see again is

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:50.640
that fascism is a religion and it is meant that the person is supposed to and take this idol of

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:58.720
the state as god as god the father and live his life with no other gods before him and to venerate

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:04.640
this thing and make it a intrinsic part of his character and to accept the discipline of this

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:12.560
austere hating easy life state and work hard in order to glorify the idol that is here and in fact

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:19.760
it becomes not just your soul but the soul of your soul and so the footnote here um from has

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:26.240
two quotes one from 26 and one in in pisa and one in 29 in milan it says it it is fascism which has

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:31.840
refashioned the character of the italians removing impurity from our souls tempering us to all

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:38.160
sacrifices restoring the true aspect of strength and beauty to our italian face it is not out of

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.800
place to illustrate the intrinsic character and profound significance of the fascist levy

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.840
it is not merely a ceremony but a very important stage in the system of education and integral

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:53.760
preparation of italian men which the fascist revolution considers one of the fundamental

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:59.040
duties of the state fundamental indeed for if the state does not fulfill this duty or in any

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:04.640
way accepts to place it under discussion the state merely and simply forfeits its right to exist

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.040
so that means it's uh got a liturgy as well

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:17.280
fascism in short this is back in the doctrine document is not only a lawgiver and foundation

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:24.960
of founder of institutions so an idolatrous god but an educator and promoter of spiritual life

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:31.760
it aims at refashioning not only the forms of life but their content man his character and his faith

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.960
to achieve this purpose it enforces discipline and uses authority entering into the soul and

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:43.360
ruling with undisputed sway therefore it has chosen its emblem as the lictors rods the symbol

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:50.560
of unity strength and justice i don't know what to tell you this fascism is the state as god the

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:58.000
father as as an idol and nobody pushing it as a spiritual reawakening has the slightest amount

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:04.720
of ground to stand on they are pushing idolatry of the worst nastiest kind the next section is

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:09.440
titled political and social doctrine evolution from socialism so when i said earlier that in

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.720
fact we would see that fascism is the same in kind different in degree that it is the antithesis

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:22.080
that arises out of the thesis of socialism of marxism here's what i'm talking about they are

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.960
explaining in this section which i don't know that i really need to read a lot of it but i probably

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:33.440
will that fascism mussolini is explaining that fascism evolved out of it is the antithesis to

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:40.400
in the dialectical setting it is the it is the antithesis to marxism into socialism it says when

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:47.040
now when in the now distant march of 1919 speaking through the columns of the populo de italia i

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.000
summoned to milan the surviving interventionists who had intervened and who had followed me ever

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.600
since the foundation of the fasci of revolutionary action in january of 1915 i had in mind no

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.640
specific doctrinal program the only doctrine of which i had practical experience was that of

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:11.200
socialism from until the winter of 1914 nearly a decade my experience was that of both follower and

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:16.720
leader but it was not doctrinal experience my doctrine during that period had been the doctrine

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:23.600
of action a uniform universally accepted doctrine of socialism had not existed since 1905 when the

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:29.280
revisionist movement headed by bernstein arose in germany countered by the formation in the seesaw

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:34.560
of tendencies of a left revolutionary movement which in italy never quitted the field of phrases

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.800
whereas in the case of russian socialism it became the prelude to bolshevism

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:47.040
reformism revolutionism centrism the very echo of that terminology is dead while in the great river

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:53.520
of fascism one can trace currents which had their source in sorrel pegui legardel of the movement

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:59.440
socialists and in the cohort of italian syndicalists who form who from 1904 to 1914

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.920
brought a new note into the italian socialist environment previously emasculated and chlora

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:10.560
formed by fornicating with gelati's party a note sounded in olivetti's paginae liberae

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:22.160
orano's lupa and rico leone's uh diver deven devenere's social socials when the war ended in 1919

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:27.440
socialism of the doctrine was already dead it continued to exist only as a grudge especially

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:33.760
in italy where its only chance lay in inciting to reprisals against the men who had willed the war

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:41.680
and who were to be made to pay for it the papalo d'italia described itself in its subtitle as the

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:47.600
daily organ of fighters and producers the word producer was already the expression of a mental

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:53.760
trend fascism was not the nursling of a doctrine previously drafted at a desk it was born of the

01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:00.320
need of action and was action it was not a party but in the first two years an anti-party and a

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:07.280
movement the name i gave the organization fixed its character yet if anyone dares to cares i

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:11.440
should say to reread the now crumpled sheets of those days giving an account of the meeting at

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:17.200
which the italian fasci de combatamento were founded he will find not a doctrine but a series

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.240
of pointers forecasts hints which when freed from the inevitable matrix of contingencies

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.720
were to develop in a few years time to into a series of doctrinal positions

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:32.080
entitling fascism to rank as a political doctrine different from all others past or present

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:38.560
quoting himself he says if the bourgeoisie i then said believe that they have found in us their

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:44.160
lightning conductors they are mistaken we must go toward the people we wish the working classes to

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:48.400
accustom themselves to the responsibilities of management so that they may realize that there is

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:54.080
no that it is no easy matter to run a business we will fight both technical and spiritual

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:59.040
re-regardism now that the succession of the regime is open we must not be faint-hearted

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:05.040
we must rush forward if the present regime is to be superseded we must take its place the right of

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:10.400
succession is ours for we urge the country to enter the war and we led it to victory

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.720
this the existing forms of political representation cannot satisfy us we want

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:22.160
direct duress direct i i guessed direst i don't know it's typo we want we'll say direct

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:27.440
representation of several interests it may be objected that this program implies a return to

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:34.560
the guild's corpora zioni uh corpora zioni uh no matter i therefore hope this assembly will accept

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:40.320
the economic claims advanced by national syndicalism is it not strange from the very

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:47.360
first day at piazza san uh sepulcro the word guild corpora zioni was pronounced a word which

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.160
as the revolution developed was to express one of the basic legislative and social creations

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:58.400
of the regime the years preceding the march on rome cover a period during which the need of action

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:04.000
forbade delay and careful doctrinal elaborations fighting was going on in the towns and villages

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:08.080
there were discussions but there was something more sacred and more important

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:17.600
death fascists knew how to die state is an idol death cult a doctrine fully elaborated divided

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:23.040
up into chapters and paragraphs with annotations may have been lacking but it was replaced by

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:29.200
something far more decisive by a faith all the time if with the help of the books articles

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:33.680
resolutions passed at congress's major and minor speeches anyone should care to revive the memory

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:38.720
of those days he will find provided he knows how to seek and select that the doctrinal foundations

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:44.240
were laid while the battle was still raging indeed it was during those years that fascist thought

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:49.440
armed refined itself and proceeded ahead with its organization the problems of the individual

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:54.320
and the state the problems of authority and liberty political social and more especially

01:31:54.320 --> 01:32:00.640
national problems were discussed the conflict with liberal democratic socialistic masonic doctrines

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:06.880
and those with the partito populare were carried on at the same time as the punitive expeditions

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:14.960
partito populare sorry i don't do italian either nevertheless the lack of a formal system was used

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:20.080
by disingenuous adversaries as an argument for proclaiming fascism incapable of elaborating a

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:26.240
doctrine at the very time when that doctrine was being formulated no matter how tumultuously first

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:32.000
as is the case with all new ideas in the guise of violent dogmatic negations then in the more

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:38.400
positive guise of constructive theories subsequently incorporated in 1926 27 and 28 in the laws and

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:45.040
institutions of the regime fascism is now clearly defined not only as regime but as a doctrine

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:50.400
that means that fascism exercising its critical faculties on itself and others has studied from

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:55.200
its own special standpoint and judged by its own standards all the problems affecting the material

01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:00.560
and intellectual interests now causing such grave anxiety to the nations of the world and is ready

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:06.160
to deal with them by its own policies so i just read that very quickly without much commentary

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:11.120
specifically because what you see is that it evolved out of socialism it is the antithesis

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:16.560
to socialism in the dialectical sense which means that the end goal is to fuse them to see that

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:21.840
fascism and communism or fascism and socialism are actually two sides of the same coin and we

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:26.880
need to understand it as one coin in other words mix the parts of them together that work to create

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:32.560
a comprehensive totalitarian system which is what we're dealing with today both from left and now

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:41.760
also from right rejection of pacifism as a pillar of fascism first of all as regards the future

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:47.520
development of mankind and quite apart from all present political considerations fascism does not

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:52.800
generally speaking believe in the possibility or utility of perpetual peace it therefore

01:33:52.800 --> 01:34:00.080
discards pacifism as a cloak for cowardly supine renunciation and contradistinction to self-sacrifice

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:07.280
war alone keys up all human energies to their maximum tension and sets the seal of nobility

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:13.280
on these on those peoples who have the courage to face it all other tests are substitutes which

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:18.080
never place a man face to face with himself before the alternative of life or death

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:25.600
so fascism is based off of the concept of dying for your idol in the state therefore all doctrines

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:31.280
which postulate peace at all costs are incompatible with fascism equally foreign to the spirit of

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.400
fascism even if accepted as useful in meeting special political situations are all

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:41.520
internationalistic or league superstructures which as history shows crumble to the ground whenever

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:46.720
the heart of nations is deeply stirred by sentimental idealistic or practical considerations

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:54.080
fascism carries this anti-pacifistic attitude into the life of the individual i don't care a damn

01:34:54.080 --> 01:35:00.000
the proud motto of the fighting squads scrawled by a wounded man on his bandages is not only an

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.680
act of philosophic stoicism it sums up a doctrine which is not merely political it is evidence of a

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:12.400
fighting spirit which accepts all risks it signifies new style of italian life the fascist

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:18.160
accepts and loves life he rejects and despises suicide is cowardly life as he understand it

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:25.360
means duty elevation conquest life must be lofty and full it must be lived for oneself but above

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:32.240
all for others both nearby and far off present and future so it's it's still collectivist

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:37.840
it's just that the state becomes god the father to rule forever instead of self-sacrificial

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:46.960
to to to wither away at the peak of its power the population policy of the regime is the consequence

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:51.840
of these premises the fascist loves his neighbor but the word neighbor does not stand for some

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:57.280
vague and unceasable conception love of one's neighbor does not exclude necessary educational

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.320
severity in other words you can severely educate your neighbor to be a fascist

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:07.520
still less does it exclude differentiation and rank so it'll be very hierarchical who's on top

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:13.200
and who's not fascism will have nothing to do with universal embraces as a member of the community of

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:19.520
nations it looks other people's straight in the eyes it is vigilant and on guard it follows others

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.000
in their manifestations and notes any changes in their interests and it does not allow itself to

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:32.160
be deceived by mutable and fallacious appearances pillar rejection of marxism so as i was saying

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:36.880
same in kind different degree it is the antithesis such a conception of life makes

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:42.960
fascism the resolute negation of the doctrine underlying so-called scientific marxian marxian

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:48.080
socialism the doctrine of historic materialism which would explain history of the history of

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:52.720
mankind in terms of the class struggle and by changes in the processes and instruments of

01:36:52.720 --> 01:37:00.080
production to the exclusion of all else so this by the way is why marxists consider everything

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:05.280
they don't like that's opposed to them fascism because their kissing cousin which is fascism

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:10.000
that evolved out of them as reaction is into antithetical reaction within the dialectical

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:18.240
movement of history actually openly rejects them so as the open rejection of marxism is a pillar

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:24.640
of fascism anything that rejects marxism must also be fascism and thus you see their stupid

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:31.840
anti-fascist stand that the vicissitudes of economic life discoveries of raw materials new

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.880
technical processes and scientific inventions have their importance no one denies but that they

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:43.040
suffice to explain human history to the exclusion of other factors is absurd fascism believes now

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:49.280
and always in sanctity and heroism that is to say in acts in which no economic motive remote

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:56.560
or immediate is at work having denied historic materialism which sees men as seasoned men mere

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:01.600
puppets on the surface of history appearing and disappearing on the crest of the waves while in

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:06.880
the depths the real directing forces move and work fascism also denies the immutable and irreparable

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.520
character of the class struggle which is the natural outcome of this economic conception of

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:16.480
history see so fascists don't conceive economic history as the movement of economic forces

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:22.160
colliding with one another it sees the movement of history as the ability for man to unify in duty

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:30.160
around a state conception a state idol above all it denies that the class struggle is a preponderating

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:36.480
agent in social transformations no it sees the state the unification within the state as the

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:42.240
the the social transform uh transformation element having thus struck a blow at socialism

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.720
and the two main points of his doctrine all that remains of it is the sentimental aspiration as

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:51.760
old as humanity itself towards social relations in which the sufferings and sorrows of the humbler

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:57.920
folk will be alleviated but here again fascism rejects the economic interpretation of felicity

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:02.560
as something to be secured socialistically almost automatically at a given stage of economic

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:09.840
evolution when all will be assured of a maximum of material comfort fascism denies the materialistic

01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.640
conception of happiness as a possibility and abandons it to the economists of the mid 18th

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:20.640
century this means that fascism denies the equation well-being equals happiness which sees

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:26.080
in men mere animals content when they can feed and fatten thus reducing them to a vegetative

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:34.240
existence pure and simple rejection of parliamentary democracy as a sham and a fraud

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:41.200
after socialism fascism trains its guns on the whole block of democratic ideologies and rejects

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.920
both their premises and their practical applications and implements fascism denies

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:50.480
that numbers as such can be the determining factor in human society so it's not really

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:54.560
on that whole consent to the governed thing unless it forces the governed to consent to

01:39:54.560 --> 01:40:00.640
the fascist government oh it manufactures a consent and it's idle it denies the right of

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.800
numbers to govern by means of periodic consultations so we don't need elections

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:12.080
it asserts the irredeemable infertile and beneficent inequality of men who cannot be

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:18.240
leveled by any such mechanical and extrinsic device as universal suffrage so it embraces

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:24.000
inequality and oppression as i've argued repeatedly democratic regimes may be

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:29.920
may be described as those under which the people are from time to time deluded into the belief that

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:35.760
they exercise sovereignty while all the time real sovereignty resides in and is exercised by

01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:40.800
other and sometimes irresponsible and secret forces all that can be true but that doesn't

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:46.160
mean we need to throw away all of our power and our freedom and give it to irresponsible

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:52.240
and secret forces in the form of a fascist state democracy is a kingless regime infested by many

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:58.160
kings who are sometimes more exclusive tyrannical and destructive than one even if he be a tyrant

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:03.280
this explains why fascism although for contingent reasons it was republican in tendency prior to

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:09.360
1922 in other words it had to lie until it could take power properly abandoned that stand before

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:14.800
the march on rome convinced that the form of government is no longer a matter of preeminent

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:20.080
importance because the study of past and present monarchies and past and present republic shows

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:27.440
that neither monarchy nor republic can be judged uh subspecies oh god it's in latin

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:32.640
i turned not to say under the aspect of eternity i had to look it up that is as universally and

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:39.440
eternally true so let me just read it in english um because the study of past and present monarchies

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:44.720
and past and present republic shows that neither monarchy nor republic can be judged as universal

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:50.320
and eternally true but that each stands for a form of government expressing the political

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:55.840
evolution the history the traditions and the psychology of the given country fascism has

01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:01.440
outgrown the dilemma monarchy versus republic over which democratic regimes too long dallied

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:06.480
attributing all insufficiencies to the former and proving the latter as a regime of perfection

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.240
whereas experience teaches that some republics are inherently reactionary and absolutist while

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:19.600
some monarchies accept the most daring political and social experiments in one of his philosophic

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:26.480
meditations renan who had the pacifist institution a pre-fascist institution sorry remarks reason and

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:31.920
science are the products of mankind but it is chimerical to seek reason directly for the people

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:37.680
and through the people it is so elections bad it is not essential to the existence of reason that

01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:42.160
it should be that all should be familiar with it so lots of people shouldn't be qualified to vote

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:46.880
and even if all had to be initiated this could not be achieved through democracy which seems

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:51.760
fated to lead to the extinction of all arduous forms of culture and all highest forms of learning

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:55.360
so only the people who understand the sense of fascism should really have the vote is what this

01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:00.080
is saying the maxim that society exists only for the well-being and freedom of the individuals

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.280
composing it does not seem to be in conformity with nature's plans which care only for the

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:10.960
species and seem ready to sacrifice the individual it is much to be feared that the last word of

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.520
democracy thus understood and let me hasten to add that it is susceptible for a different

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:20.560
interpretation would be a form of society in which a degenerate mass would have no thought beyond

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:26.880
that of enjoying the ignoble pleasures of the vulgar so it doesn't think much of democracy

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:33.760
rejection of egalitarianism in rejecting democracy fascism rejects the absurd conventional lie of

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:40.720
political equalitarianism the habit of collective irresponsibility the myth of felicity and

01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:48.640
indefinite progress definition of fascism as real democracy but if democracy be understood as

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:54.000
meaning a regime in which the masses are not driven back to the margin of the state and then

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.680
the writer of these pages has already defined fascism as an organized centralized authoritarian

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:06.880
democracy this is identical to mao's conception of uh democratic centralism which probably borrowed

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:12.960
from the fascists to be honest rejection of economic liberalism and admiration of bismarck

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:18.320
fascism is definitely and absolutely opposed to the doctrines of liberalism

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:23.360
both in the political and the economic sphere the importance of liberalism in the 19th century

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:28.000
should not be exaggerated for present-day polemical purposes nor should we make of one

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.520
of the many doctrines which flourished in that century a religion for mankind for the present

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:39.760
and for all time to come liberalism really flourished for 15 years only it arose in 1930

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:46.080
as a reaction to the holy alliance which tried to force europe to recede further back than 1789

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:54.480
it touched zenith in 1848 when even pious the ninth was a liberal its decline began immediately

01:44:54.480 --> 01:45:02.320
after that year if 1848 was a year of light and poetry 1849 was a year of darkness and tragedy

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:07.200
the roman republic was killed by a sister republic that of france in that same year

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:14.160
marx and his famous communist manifesto launched the gospel of socialism in 1851 napoleon the third

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:19.600
made his a liberal coup d'etat and ruled france until 1870 when he was turned out by a popular

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:25.440
rising following one of the severest military defeats known to history the victory was bismarck

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:31.440
who never even knew the whereabouts of liberalism and its profits it is symptomatic that through the

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:36.800
19th century the religion of liberalism was completely unknown to so highly civilized people

01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:43.040
as the germans but for one parenthesis which has been described as the ridiculous parliament of

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:49.280
frankfurt which lasted just one season germany attained her national unity outside of liberalism

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:55.120
and in opposition to liberalism that's a great thing to uphold here germany's done great a

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:59.680
doctrine which seems foreign to the german temperament essentially monarchical whereas

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:05.040
liberalism is the historical and logical anti-room to anarchy you hear that from the

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:11.200
the new right today all the time but it's nonsense the three stages in the making of the german unity

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:18.560
were the three wars of 1864 1866 and 1870 led by such liberals as moltke and bismarck and in the

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:23.440
upbuilding of the italian unity liberalism played a very minor part when compared to the contribution

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:29.680
made by mazzini and garibaldi who were not liberals but for the intervention of the illiberal

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:35.200
napoleon the third we should not have had lombardi and without that of the illiberal bismarck at

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:42.400
sadawa and at sadan we probably would not we would should not have had venetia in 1866 and in 1870 we

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:49.040
would not have entered rome the years going from 1870 to 1915 cover a period which marked even in

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:53.840
the opinion of the high priests of the new creed the twilight of their religion attacked by

01:46:53.840 --> 01:47:00.240
decadentism in literature and by activism in practice activism that is to say nationalism

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:07.200
futurism and fascism the liberal century after piling up innumerable gordian knots tried to cut

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:13.120
them with the sword of the world war never has any religion claimed so cruel a sacrifice where the

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:18.240
gods of liberalism thirsting for blood you hear these same kinds of arguments by the way from this

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:23.440
new right today now liberalism is preparing to close the doors of its temples deserted by the

01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:29.280
peoples who feel that the agnosticism it professed in the sphere of economics and the indifferentism

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.920
of which it has given proof in the spheres of politics and morals would lead the world to ruin

01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:39.280
in the future as they have done in the past this explains why all the political experiments of our

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:44.480
day are anti-liberal and now we can look back 100 years later and see how those worked out which is

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.760
really bad and it is supremely ridiculous to endeavor on this account to put them outside of

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:56.240
the pale of history as though history were a perverse set a preserve set aside for liberalism

01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:01.520
and its adepts as though liberalism were the last word in civilization beyond which no one can go

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:06.240
well you tried to go past that with your fascist totalitarianism and it turned out to go really

01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:12.720
badly so the next section is called the fascist totalitarian vision of the future the fascist

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.600
negation of socialism democracy liberalism should not however be interpreted as implying a desire

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:24.560
to drive the world backwards to positions occupied prior to 1789 french revolution a year commonly

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:30.240
referred to as that which opened the demo liberal century history does not travel backwards the

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:36.720
fascist doctrine has not taken to master as its profit monarchical absolution absolutism is of

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:44.000
the past and so is ecclesiology dead and done for our feudal privileges and the division of society

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.760
into closed uncommunicating castes neither has the fascist conception of authority anything in common

01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:58.640
with that of a police-ridden state except in practice a party governing a nation totalitarianly

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:03.440
is a new departure in history see you don't need police state when you just make everybody believe

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:09.680
the right thing all the time there are no points of reference nor of comparison from beneath the

01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:14.560
ruins of liberal socialist and democratic doctrines fascism extracts those elements which are still

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:20.640
vital it preserves what may be described as the acquired facts of history and rejects all else

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:26.000
that is to say it rejects the idea of a doctrine suited to all times and to all people so it's

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.240
going to just be a totalitarian state that does whatever it has to do to maintain power okay got

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:35.920
you granted that the 19th century was the century of socialism liberalism democracy this does not

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.800
mean that the 20th century must also be the century of socialism liberalism and democracy

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:46.960
political doctrines pass nations remain we are free to believe that this is the century of authority

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.960
a century tending to the right a fascist century now i actually disagree when he says

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:56.640
here political doctrines pass the nations remain he says that nations are a people

01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:00.480
but i think that nations are actually constituted in their constitutions and so if you completely

01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:05.680
reorganize the political constitution of a country you actually have a new country you don't have the

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.120
same nation you have a different nation it can call itself italy before and after but it's still

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:15.920
a different nation and it's not just the people that's a that's a folkish way of thinking that's

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:22.560
being resurrected today as it was being then if the 19th century was a century of the individual

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:27.200
because liberalism implies individualism we're free to believe that this is the collective

01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:33.280
century and therefore the century of the state well there you have it folks state as an idol

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:39.840
it is quite logical for a new doctrine to make use of the still vital elements of other doctrines

01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:46.000
no doctrine was ever born quite new and bright and unheard of no doctor can boast absolute

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.960
originality it is always connected it only historically with those which preceded it and

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:56.080
those which will follow it in other words fascism arose out of socialism it is the dialectical

01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:02.880
antithesis which will lead to a synthesis of the two thus the scientific socialism of marx links

01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:08.240
up to the utopian socialism of the foyer's owens the saint simones thus the liberalism of the 19th

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:13.200
century traces its origins back to the illuministic movement of the 18th that's straight projection

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:18.480
it's the other way and the doctrines of democracy to those of the encyclopedist so he's blending the

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.080
he's because he keeps saying 1789 what he's doing is he's taking the french

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:30.720
revolution as emblematic of liberalism which that is incorrect in fact he is the communism followed

01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:35.920
from from the french revolution and fascism followed from communism liberalism has stood

01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:42.880
opposed to both all along so it's actually he's completely wrong on this in the same way that we

01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.600
see the the new right being wrong on these things today i wonder where they got their ideas well

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:50.720
they are they're reading the fascist philosophers that's where they got their stupid ideas

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:56.560
all doctrines aim at directing the activities of men he says toward a given objective

01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:01.760
but these activities in their turn react on the doctrine modifying and adjusting it to new needs

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:08.080
or outstripping it a doctrine must therefore be a vital act and not a verbal display hence the

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:13.680
pragmatic strain in fascism its will to power its will to live its attitude toward violence

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:21.040
and its value next section is the absolute primacy of the state the keystone of the

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:26.240
fascist doctrine is its conception of the state of its essence its functions and its aims for

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:33.040
fascism the state is absolute individuals and groups relative individually so it's god it's

01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:38.880
the idol individuals and groups are admissible insofar as they come within the state instead

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:43.520
of directing the game and guiding the material and moral progress of the community the liberal

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:49.760
state restricts activities its activities to recording results the fascist state is wide awake

01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:56.080
and has a will of its own for this reason it can be described as ethical at the first quint

01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:03.520
quinquennial sorry assembly of the regime in 1929 i said the fascist state is not a night watchman

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:08.960
solicitous only of the personal safety of the citizens nor is it organized exclusively for

01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:12.960
the purpose of guaranteeing a certain degree of material prosperity and relatively peaceful

01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:18.400
conditions of life a board of directors would do as much neither is it exclusively political

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:23.280
divorced from practical realities and holding itself aloof from the multifarious activities

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:28.720
of the citizens and the nation the state as conceived and realized by fascism is a spiritual

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:35.280
and ethical entity for securing the political juridical and economic organization of the nation

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:42.000
an organization which in its origin and growth is a manifestation of the spirit the state

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.960
guarantees the internal and external safety of the country but it also safeguards and transmits

01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:53.600
the spirit of the people elaborated down the ages and its language its customs its faith the state

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:59.280
is not only the present it is also the past and above all the future transcending the individual's

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:04.480
brief spell of life the state stands for the imminent conscious conscience of the nation

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:10.080
the forms in which it finds expression change but the need for it remains the state educates

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:16.400
the citizens the civics makes them aware of their mission urges them to unity its justice

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:21.760
harmonizes their divergent interests it transmits to future generations the conquests of the mind

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:28.800
and the fields of science art law human solidarity it leads men from the primitive tribal life to

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:36.240
that highest manifestation of human power which is imperial rule the state is an idol in fascism

01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:41.200
the state hands down to future generations the memory of those who laid down their lives to

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:47.200
ensure its safety or to obey its laws it sets up as examples and records for the future ages

01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.840
the names of the captains who enlarged its territory and of the men of genius who made it

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.680
famous whatever respect for the state declines in the disintegrating and centrifugal tendencies

01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:02.880
of individuals and groups prevail nations are headed for decay that's the end of his long quote

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:10.080
there since 1929 economic and political development have everywhere emphasized these truths

01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:14.960
the importance of the state is rapidly growing the so-called crisis can only be settled by

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:21.120
state action within the orbit of the state where are the shades of the jewels simons who in the

01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:26.160
early days of liberalism proclaimed that the state should endeavor to render itself useless and

01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:31.280
prepare to hand in its resignation of the mcculloughs who in the second half of this of the

01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:35.920
last century urged that the state should desist from governing too much and what of the english

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:41.520
bentham who considered that all industry asked of government was to be left alone and of the german

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:46.400
humbolt who expressed the opinion that the best government was a lazy one what would they say now

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:52.080
to the unceasing inevitable and urgently requested interventions of government and business it is

01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:56.480
true that if the second generation of economists was less uncompromising this respect than the

01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:01.520
first and even that adam smith left the door jar however cautiously for government intervention

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:07.520
in business because if liberalism spells individualism fascism spells government and so

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:12.720
that's your statement of fascism right there if liberalism spells individualism fascism spells

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:19.280
government and what he's saying there just to summarize is that it was bs to ever think that

01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:23.440
the government wouldn't be involved in business public-private partnership or the the corporate

01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:30.560
subsidiarity state is exactly how things really work economically and work best he says the

01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:36.320
fascist state is however a unique and original creation it is not reactionary yes it is but

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.680
revolutionary oh because it's a continuation of communism in another direction for it anticipates

01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:46.000
the solution of certain universal problems which have been raised elsewhere in the political field

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.600
by the splitting up of parties the usurpation of power by parliaments the irresponsibility of

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:56.160
assemblies in the economic field by the increasingly numerous and important functions

01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:02.240
discharged by trade unions and trade associations with the disputes and intents affecting both

01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:07.760
capital and labor in the ethical field by the need for felt the need felt for order discipline

01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:14.720
and obedience to the moral dictates of patriotism fascism desires the state to be strong and organic

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:21.200
based on broad foundations of popular support fascist state lays claim to rule in the economic

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.840
field no less than in others it makes its actions felt throughout the length and breadth of the

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:31.360
country by means of its corporative social and educational institutions and all the political

01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:36.400
economic and spiritual forces of the nation organized in their respective associations

01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:42.720
circulate within the state a state based on millions of individuals who recognize its

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:47.680
authority feel its action and are ready to serve its ends is not the tyrannical state of a medieval

01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:54.400
lordling has nothing in common with the despotic states existing prior to or subsequent to 1789 no

01:57:54.400 --> 01:58:00.160
no it's totally different it's not despotic it's totalitarian that means everybody's entire life

01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:06.000
entire being has to be transformed and supporting the idol that's what it means just like with

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.760
communism it is same and kind different in degree says far from crushing the individual you know

01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:16.080
here's more communist bullshit but it's fascist this time the fascist state multiplies his

01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:22.240
energies just as in the regiment of a soldier just as in a regiment a soldier is not diminished but

01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.640
multiplied by the number of his fellow soldiers the fascist state organizes the nation but it

01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:32.720
leaves the individual adequate elbow room sounds just like mao it has curtailed useless or harmful

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:39.040
liberties oh it is curtailed useful useless or harmful liberties while preserving those which

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:44.000
are essential in such matters the individual cannot be the judge but the state only so the

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.480
state's going to decide what it is that you can and cannot do which of your liberties are useless

01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:53.840
and harmful in which are essential we just learned all about essential workers well here you have

01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:58.240
essential uh liberties that you're allowed to do and the rest are useless or harmful and the state

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:03.440
will not permit them you as an individual have no right to choose anything to do with your own life

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:08.000
and its liberties the state will choose them for you and extend them to you as privileges so do not

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.960
let these people in the new right convince you that this is some higher expression of freedom

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:17.600
that's the same lie that's been told by fascists and the same lie that's been told by communists for

01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:24.640
a hundred years the fascist state he tells us is not indifferent to religious phenomena in general

01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:29.920
nor does it maintain an attitude of indifference to roman catholicism the special positive religion

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:35.200
of italians the state has not got a theology but it has a moral code oh it doesn't have a theology

01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:39.920
does it that's because it is its own theology he says the fascist state sees in religion one of the

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:44.640
deepest spiritual manifestations and for this reason it is not it not only respects religion

01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:50.960
but defends and protects it some religions anyway the fascist state does not attempt as it rubs pierre

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:54.720
at the height of the revolutionary delirium of the convention to set up a god of its own

01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:59.280
nor does it vainly seek as does bolshevism to efface god from the soul of man

01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:06.320
fascism respects the god of aesthetics st saints and heroes and it also respects god as conceived

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:12.320
by the ingenuous and primitive heart of the people the god to whom their prayers are raised

02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:18.240
in other words it doesn't actually have a religious doctrine but it's going to make sure

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:23.360
that you adhere to a religious doctrine and whichever one is fine it doesn't really care

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:29.040
it's not really bringing god back into the picture the state is actually god but there's you're going

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:34.160
to have to believe in some kind of a higher power god that the state is a reflection of

02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:40.240
the fascist state expresses the will to exercise power and to command it here the roman tradition

02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:45.840
is embodied in a conception of strength imperial power is understood by the fascist doctrine is

02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:51.840
not only territorial or military or commercial it is also spiritual and ethical an imperial

02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:57.440
nation that is to say a nation which directly or indirectly as a leader of others can exist without

02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:03.360
the need of conquering a single square mile of territory fascism sees in the imperialistic spirit

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:09.280
that is in the tendency of nations to expand a manifestation of their vitality in the opposite

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:14.160
tendency which would limit their interest to the home country it sees a symptom of decadence

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:20.880
peoples who rise or re-arise are imperialistic renunciation is characteristic of dying peoples

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:26.400
the fascist doctrine is that best suited to the tendencies and feelings of a people which like the

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:31.280
italian after lying fallow during centuries of foreign servitude are now reasserting itself

02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:38.160
in the world but imperialism implies discipline the coordination of efforts a deep sense of duty

02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:45.120
and a spirit of self-sacrifice so the state becomes the deity this explains many aspects

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:51.280
of the practical activity of the regime and the direction taken by many of the forces of the state

02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:56.160
as also the severity which has to be exercised toward those who would oppose the spontaneous

02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:01.440
and inevitable movement of the 20th century italy by agitating outgrown ideologies of the 19th

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:06.160
century ideologies rejected wherever great experiments in political and social

02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:10.960
transformations are being dared we see where those ended up by the way in major ditches

02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:17.840
never before he says have the people thirsted for authority direction order as they do now so those

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:23.120
are warning signs that that fascism is coming is that how you feel today is that what the new

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:28.400
right is tapping into sounds like it if each age has its doctrine then innumerable symptoms

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:35.360
indicate that the doctrine of our age is the fascist that it is vital excuse me that it is

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:41.040
vital is shown by the fact that it has aroused a faith that this faith has conquered souls is shown

02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:47.440
by the fact that fascism can point to its fallen heroes and its martyrs fascism has now acquired

02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:52.400
throughout the world that universal that universally i guess universality which belongs

02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:59.520
to all doctrines which by achieving self-expression represent a moment in the history of human thought

02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.400
and so there's your expression of fascism that's what fascism is in the words of mussolini that is

02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:10.560
the doctrine of fascism we hear this arising from the so-called new right the dissident right that's

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:16.160
not a good development we also see that it is actually the antithetical continuation of

02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:22.560
communism it is thesis antithesis synthesis is the main goal and so what you actually see here

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:29.680
is a system of taking the state no longer as a self-sacrificing entity that liberates man from

02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:37.120
his own imprisonment but rather that it becomes a idol that through the worship of and fealty to

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:43.440
the state becomes the guarantor of of man's supremacy this is this is a shift from

02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:50.240
as sick and upside down as it is to say communism holding up the state as a christ figure

02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:55.280
and it's a switch to the state being held up as a god figure as an emanating holy spirit that

02:03:55.280 --> 02:04:00.800
will transform man into a functionary of the state as to an integral piece of the state and he's

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:05.520
considered a non-entity without that the state gives him not just his soul but the soul of his

02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:11.760
soul and so this is idolatry of the grossest form i think it's very important that we reject

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:17.600
this that we do not allow this to derail the movement against woke or the fight back against

02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:23.920
woke or whatever it is that we don't allow us to derail the upcoming election it being 2024 now

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:30.240
and the election coming we don't we we know that the that the left broadly speaking will use this

02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:35.440
either as a means of directly seizing power if it has the capacity to do that to throw away liberty

02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:42.560
or if it cannot as a means to drive the resistance to the sustainable and inclusion woke movement

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:46.160
that all that resistance is going to get driven into a ditch by promoting things that

02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:51.520
scare normal people into believing that it is an existential crisis for them to fight against

02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:58.640
conservatives this is why this is happening isn't it really good question i have severely severely

02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:04.000
cynical suspicions as to why people like franco are being pushed why fascism is being pushed

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.560
why we're seeing all this uh rise of this kind of chest beating while we're seeing all this

02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:15.360
new misogyny this manliness characterized here in fascism by mussolini something bad is happening

02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:22.720
and um there's an explicit and deliberate push from agents of provocation or whatever on the

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:28.640
internet toward fascism and we should be taking this very seriously and not losing track the

02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:32.880
answer lies in the constitution the answer lies in liberty the answer lies actually in the other

02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:39.840
1789 which was the the year of the constitution the answer lies in um putting human liberty first

02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:46.480
securing individual rights avoiding collectivism avoiding corporatism denying the idea of a

02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:52.080
corporate subsidiarity model that is going to be able to produce but removes all human freedom and

02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:56.960
makes us happy in the sense you know we'll own nothing and be happy in the sense that we are a

02:05:56.960 --> 02:06:02.960
part of the movement of history toward some kind of totalitarian end the thesis gives rise to the

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:08.320
antithesis communism gives rise to fascism but in the end they're to be seen as the same in kind but

02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:13.680
different in degree two parts of the same coin and synthesized and fused into one model which is

02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:17.360
exactly what we see happening in the world which is why you see communism being pushed through

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:23.360
corporations worldwide in china and here in the west through the un and the world economic forum

02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:31.760
in the world health organization

02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:54.740
you
