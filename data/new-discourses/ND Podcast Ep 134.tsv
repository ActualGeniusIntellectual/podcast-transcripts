0	23280	Hey everybody, and welcome to another episode of the New Discourses podcast.
23280	24340	This is James Lindsay.
24340	25800	We got to talk about fascism.
25800	32280	We spend a lot of time talking about communism, obviously I've dedicated most of my project
32280	38060	to that, but we should talk a little bit about fascism too, and I want to actually, what
38060	42240	I'm going to do in this episode is I'm going to actually read to you from Mussolini.
42240	50160	I'm going to read to you The Doctrine of Fascism by Benito Mussolini, which he articulated.
50160	54600	It's written as an article, I assume he wrote it down, but maybe he spoke it.
54600	60120	It also borrows from a lot of quotes that are given as footnotes that I'll present to
60120	64960	you as well for context, but this is from 1932, and I don't think you're going to find
64960	69120	a more clear articulation of the principles of fascism.
69120	72000	So let's put the dates on this.
72000	74000	We're looking at this being in 1932.
74000	78440	The fascists have had a fair amount of power in Italy for a while.
78440	82800	We can know that, for example, just from our understanding of communist history because
82800	88360	the fascists were the ones who locked up Antonio Gramsci, and they locked up Antonio Gramsci,
88360	92740	obviously the father of cultural Marxism, in 1926.
92740	99720	And so at this point, the fascists have had power for a little while, and Mussolini is
99720	106280	now writing down the principles of, or the doctrine of fascism itself.
106280	112120	What I'm reading to you is an article that's on the web that is a complete translation
112120	120320	of the doctrine of fascism with added context in footnotes that was written together, not
120320	127520	just by Benito Mussolini himself, but co-written with another guy, Giovanni Gentile, and it
127520	132680	says, their note about it is, it is considered to be the most complete articulation of Mussolini's
132680	134360	political views.
134360	138800	This is the only complete official translation we know of on the web, copied directly from
138800	144400	an official fascist government publication of 1935, which was titled Fascism Doctrine
144400	150200	and Institutions, published under the name of Benito Mussolini, and all the original
150200	152240	footnotes it says are included.
152240	157500	So I guess those footnotes were not added by this website, but are actually original.
157500	161600	Now I want to frame this before we talk about it because I don't want to just say, oh, here's
161600	162600	some fascism.
162600	164580	That's what we're doing here.
164580	165580	Why on earth?
165580	169420	In fact, I've been wanting to make this podcast for like a month and I'm like, I don't know
169420	171580	why I want, like, I want to present this.
171580	174580	I want people to see this, but I don't know why.
174580	179620	I don't know the explanation and I've been thinking about it really hard for a long time
179620	184300	and I finally have kind of come across what it is and you would think that maybe what
184300	191120	I want to talk about is this obvious rise on the weird kind of cool kids right or whatever
191120	198360	we want to call these guys, the new right, the dissident right, the alt right, the reactionary
198360	199360	right.
199360	204400	I don't know what to call these people, but it's infiltrated, of course, heavily into
204400	206680	what we might consider movement conservatism.
206680	211440	It's kind of like the conservative ink, like hard edge angle plus the groipers, which is
211440	213600	that's the whole Nick Fuentes thing.
213600	221020	That whole angle is just rife with this bend toward fascism, not in like, hey, that kind
221020	223940	of looks like fascism, but explicitly.
223940	227680	And whether they're real accounts or whether they're bots or whether they're something
227680	233580	else on social media, if you bring up anything related to this, there are all these apparently
233580	239300	super pro right wing accounts all over Twitter, at least that are like, yeah, fascism is the
239300	240620	only way.
240620	245620	But now we're starting to see influencers in the conservative space saying like Franco
245620	249420	was great, fascism is necessary.
249420	255700	And I think one of the ones I saw last night that really disturbed me was this general
255700	260940	idea that, well, maybe I don't really want fascism, but if it comes down to a binary
260940	265900	choice between fascism and communism, I'm going to choose fascism.
265900	270380	And so we've got to understand what fascism is.
270380	274540	And I'm going to read Mussolini so you understand what fascism is in that regard.
274540	280700	But we've got to take a step back because this is all part of dialectical leftism.
280700	285440	Fascism is the right hand of the left that has to be understood.
285440	288260	Now why would I say that?
288260	291740	Well let's back up to Hegel.
291740	296920	Actually let's back up even to Kant and talk about this dialectical way of thinking.
296920	301120	The dialectic per Kant is that you have the thesis and then there's the antithesis and
301120	303160	somehow you mix them together to get a synthesis.
303160	306100	But that's an extremely incorrect understanding.
306100	307680	Of course Hegel had it differently.
307680	310720	He never said it in terms of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.
310720	314760	He said it in terms of there's the abstract and then you meet its negation and then you
314760	319560	arrive at the concrete through the synthetic dialectical process.
319560	326640	But what is actually articulated is not that there is the thesis and its antithesis floating
326640	328520	around out there.
328520	338040	It is in fact that the antithesis or the negation arises from within the thing.
338040	339040	Do you get that?
339040	341800	That's absolutely crucial to understand.
341800	352280	The antithesis is actually opposed to the thesis but it arises from within the thesis.
352280	356160	It's not floating around out there as the opposite that you're going to find like black
356160	357840	versus white.
357840	363220	It actually arises from within the thesis.
363220	368280	So when you have an abstract conception for Hegel and this is all Hegelian dialectical
368280	379200	manipulation, fascism is a dialectical phenomenon and when you have with Hegel this abstract
379200	383640	notion that you're thinking oh well here's communism or here's whatever it happens to
383640	387640	be and we're going to take the next step but we're going to dig into it and deeper and
387680	391480	deeper and deeper do that we're going to understand it at its deepest level and as we deeper
391480	397720	deeper deeper and dig into it where what do we find oh the opposite its opposite its negation
397720	399960	is hidden within it.
399960	405320	That thing that challenges it that turns it backwards in upon itself is hidden within
405320	410520	it and then the goal is to realize and to put it in the language of the principle of
410520	417040	polarity from the original hermetic doctrines that inspired all of us in the first place.
417040	423160	The goal is to realize that the antithesis is the same in kind but different in degree
423160	428560	and fascism I think we're going to hear very clearly from Mussolini is the antithesis of
428560	434000	Marxism is the antithesis of communism but that doesn't mean that it's the opposite or
434000	437520	the actual the enemy of communism at all.
437520	443740	It is the same in kind but different in degree in other words it's the same thing presenting
443740	450060	in an oppositional way and that's what when we hear fascism you're going to hear one of
450060	457180	the principles Mussolini puts forth in fact is explicitly a rejection of Marxism and so
457180	466220	from within Marxism arises this antithesis this opposite this negation so within communism
466220	472180	arises fascism fascism is same in kind it's still a totalitarian doctrine we're going
472180	477820	to hear that too it's different in degree it's still a state worshiping doctrine but
477820	482580	it isn't worshiping the state the same way in fact I've argued in the past that communism
482580	486820	if you want to put it kind of in the Christian trinity which you actually should communism
486820	492340	actually sees the state in the position of the sun in the position of Christ it is a
492340	498200	self-sacrificial entity that will liberate man by killing itself in the end that's actually
498200	502600	the belief in communism is that socialism will rise to a zenith of power at which point
502600	507760	it will become unnecessary and wither away the state will sacrifice itself to liberate
507760	514520	all people after it transforms them into purely socialist man which is to say really returns
514520	519480	them to their true human nature because that's the belief at the heart of Marxism is that
519480	524100	the true human nature is a social creative being and that we've forgotten that because
524100	530060	we've been imposed upon by the bourgeois elements of society within both in theory
530060	537380	and in practice within that however because it's a dialectical concept is its negation
537380	543380	and its negation is fascism fascism arises from the fear and desperation that is caused
543380	550300	by communism communism I think pretty clearly is caused by some combination of laziness
550300	558340	sloth and envy and resentment it's very clearly that and you kind of codify that into a social
558340	563260	gnostic religion and you get this Marxist communism well it turns out when you provoke
563260	567820	people when you do the praxis of communism it freaks people out people think they're
567820	572820	going to lose their society and if they don't stand up right they will and what do you do
572820	576120	well you have to stand up and you wait and you put it off and you delay and things get
576120	579580	really desperate and you get really scared and that fear and desperation that arises
579580	584180	causes people to want to band together or bind together like a bundle of sticks fascio
584180	591260	in Italian and adopt a fascist attitude a new totalitarian attitude to fight back against
591260	595580	communists but in fact what you're actually doing is adopting totalitarianism anyway it's
595580	600380	the same in kind but different in degree and what happens in the end the point of the dialectic
600380	606180	isn't that there's just this thesis and antithesis this thing and it's negation it's in fact
606180	611380	that the thing in his negation the negation arises from within the thing itself and then
611380	616580	they are placed intrinsically into conflict and through that conflict the contradictions
616580	623060	are worked out so that a synthetic hole that sees both sides of those things in the same
623060	630660	light can arise that's the idea so the goal is actually that if fascism is the dialectical
630660	636580	antithesis to communism is that the two are not there to fight one another they're there
636580	642800	to merge together into one totalitarian system that actually controls everything and that's
642800	647300	exactly what we see in the latter half of the 20th century which is a story nobody seems
647300	652340	to know if you look at the success well if you look at the Soviet system or you look
652340	658460	at the even Mao's Chinese system the CCP system they didn't work they were complete catastrophes
658460	661740	now you could say that they've been very successful at subverting and infiltrating
661740	666420	and the Cold War never ended you can say all those things quite intelligently but what's
666420	671020	really kept the socialist movement alive especially in China is the fact that Deng Xiaoping came
671020	678300	along as Mao's successor in the late 1970s and adopted a model with a contained market
678300	682260	they claimed that they were opening up a market but Deng Xiaoping said it was always said
682260	686540	it was for socialism it was for the glory of socialism they were just trying to get
686540	691500	China back on its productive feet because Mao absolutely destroyed it with his own cult
691500	696820	and the CCP opened a market but it's really a Potemkin market it's not a real market it's
696820	704300	a phony market that is at the pleasure and at the behest of the CCP if you buck the CCP
704300	709300	your standing in the market goes away but as long as you play ball it looks like you
709300	713080	get to run your company you get to own your company you get to make a ton of money you
713080	717000	end up with crazy rich Asians blah blah blah everybody there is trying to make money turns
717000	723560	out that that system is not a market that system is fascism that's exactly what fascism
723560	729680	did even in Italy even in Germany in the early part of the 20th century 50 years earlier
729680	734400	what it did was it allowed people to look like they were still owning their own corporations
734400	739360	but the corporations actually operated as functionaries of the state so people were
739360	745760	able to make money production was very high the fascist model unlike the communist model
745760	750680	is actually very successful at production what it's not successful at is freedom what
750680	755120	it's not successful at is liberty but of course being dialectical they claim that they have
755120	759020	a higher understanding of what liberty and freedom actually mean and they have the only
759020	763360	true freedom we'll hear that from Mussolini we know that the communists believe that we
763360	767600	know that the fascists also well we will know the fascists also believe that but more importantly
767600	771480	what you see is a synthetic model that was developed in China that's now being copied
771480	777360	here in the West whether through ESG or natural asset companies or the public-private partnership
777360	781720	or the stakeholder capitalism or whatever terms we use for their new sustainability
781720	786280	agenda that is the same model that's happening in the CCP and what it is is that you're using
786280	792800	corporate subsidiarity to the state power there's actually one corporation that's corporation
792800	797800	is the state and then under that you have subsidiary shell corporations that operate
797800	803120	underneath the auspices of what the state wants and allows and its doctrine that's fascism
803120	808780	and they get to make crazy money so long as they prove high levels of duty and loyalty
808780	814720	everybody else gets screwed by the way the average person is not doing better than they
814720	819360	would under freedom and what happens is the goal is well you're going to need some kind
819360	823360	of a socialistic distribution model and to make sure that the regular people who don't
823360	828080	own the big huge corporations that are the subsidiaries of the state corporation have
828080	833360	have their amount or share and you're going to have basically something that works just
833360	837640	like a communist social credit system to make sure that their distribution is determined
837640	841080	correctly whether it's a distribution of labor that they have to do that they don't want
841080	846120	to do or a distribution of goods and services or universal basic income or social credit
846120	852740	or whatever it is that allows them to make way and so what you have to understand are
852740	856080	two big pieces and then we're going to talk about we're going to read Mussolini and the
856080	862880	two big pieces are first number one that fascism is the antithesis or the negation of communism
862880	866660	but understood in a dialectical process what that means is that fascism is actually the
866660	873080	bastard son of communism it is an offspring of communism it is not something that people
873080	879700	want except if they want to gain totalitarian power and the communist attempt isn't working
879700	884480	it is a reaction to communism as well but that's because it's the negation that arises
884480	891640	from within it and that the goal of a dialectical pair of opposites there is a same in kind
891640	898760	but different in degree or different in form same in kind same totalitarian system same
898760	905800	statist religion same catastrophe for the average person but on the other hand it's
905800	911400	different in degree so that the two can be synthesized and the project whether we look
911400	915160	at it in terms of Deng Xiaoping whether we look at it in terms of what Herbert Marcuse
915160	920440	was writing in one-dimensional manth in the 1960s and also in the essay on liberation
920440	925520	in the 1960s and encounter revolution and revolt in the early 1970s when we read Marcuse
925520	929720	we see very clearly that he has this issue and I've talked about this I've done podcasts
929720	932800	on this I've written essays about this I eventually should probably write a book but I already
932800	940080	wrote the essay so I don't know what to do explaining that the model was that capitalism
940080	945440	has the ability to produce but it's not sustainable so you need a sustainable capitalism paired
945440	950440	alongside dialectically paired alongside socialism which has the right ideology but it can't
950440	954960	produce so we need a productive socialism and a sustainable capitalism that become increasingly
954960	959800	close to the same model well those models are going to have to be distributist in nature
959800	965700	and distributism becomes the overarching brand that does it and what we have then is these
965700	970360	Potemkin markets like in China and like they're building under stakeholder capitalism that
970360	974640	are fascism but the reaction that we're having here just like throughout all of history is
974640	980720	a reaction to create same in kind but different in degree a fascist reaction and what happens
980720	986800	in practice like take for example the Franco did Franco save Spain well it's run by socialists
986800	991760	right now so at least in the longer run of history the answer is no no he did not in
991760	996440	fact what happens is these fascist systems don't tend to work they are very high at productivity
996440	1001960	they tend to be very for a while they tend to repel communism but they're utterly totalitarian
1001960	1007540	people become dissatisfied people get deposed people get murdered people the whole totalitarian
1007540	1011800	nightmare is still happening and the whole thing becomes unstable it's held together
1011800	1017800	typically by a military dictator who when he dies or his family dynasty falls apart
1017800	1021580	the whole thing falls apart and you end up handing a century of moral authority to the
1021580	1027020	left plus an apparatus that's already stopped defending human rights or individual rights
1027020	1029580	I shouldn't say human rights human rights is some bullshit that's out of the United
1029580	1035800	Nations the individual rights individual rights end up on that sacrificed on the altar to
1035800	1039840	build the fascist state and when then when the fascist state falls apart because it's
1039840	1044400	actually a totalitarian nightmare and it's usually held together again by a military
1044400	1051760	style dictator when that falls apart and it inevitably does you hand that apparatus plus
1051760	1056400	a century's worth of unassailable moral authority to the other side so that you just made the
1056400	1060720	job so much easier for the socialists who are going to come in and say well the excesses
1060720	1064520	of the right were awfully terrible and awfully bad and awfully scary so we're going to do
1064520	1070020	this correctly now we're going to do this in the name not of oppression but of the oppressed
1070020	1074040	and it's not hard to get massive public sentiment behind it and you see that in South America
1074040	1078800	again and again you see that in Spain you see that in Greece you see that in lots of
1078800	1083440	places that have tried to experiment with this strongman bullshit that always backfires
1083440	1087980	in the end and it makes you wonder why this is getting pushed on the so-called dissident
1087980	1094440	right or new right or whatever right idiot right fucking idiot right right now as we
1094440	1101000	go into a obviously highly important and contentious election year besides the fact
1101000	1106000	that obviously what it's going to do is give argument to all of the insane claims of the
1106000	1111580	left making those things come true reifying the left's boogeyman so that it scares your
1111580	1118340	average middle you know middling voter your average low information democrat voter who's
1118340	1121980	getting real scared that stuff's not working economically that they're doing weird stuff
1121980	1125720	with the kids that the schools are out of control and failing they're becoming cognizant
1125720	1129720	that the left thing's failing whatever is going on with this whole israel-palestine
1129720	1134160	they're getting cognizant that something's not right well better get them back scared
1134160	1139280	as shit of the republicans and of the conservatives by coming out hard with fascism and a bunch
1139280	1144800	of misogyny and hating women and badgering women for existing and whatever else and trying
1144800	1149060	to say that you want to repeal the 19th and take away their vote and like the whole thing
1149060	1154640	is designed to lose but at any rate let's pretend it's not let's pretend it's not a
1154640	1163660	pitfall it's designed to lose let's hear in mussolini's own words what fascism is so we
1163660	1171000	begin like all this is mussolini writing in the 1930s on the doctrine of fascism like
1171000	1178560	all sound political conceptions fascism is action and it is thought okay so it's theory
1178560	1182560	and praxis just like communism because it's the same in kind but different in degree got
1182560	1189400	you fascism is action and it is thought action in which doctrine is imminent that's exactly
1189400	1194360	what the point of communism is i could go read to you 30 sources like in a flash i could
1194360	1201400	pull up the definition of truth where uh on marxists.org where um they say that the there's
1201400	1204860	different definitions of truth there's the empirical definition where we check evidence
1204860	1208860	there's a rational where it has to be logically consistent there's the pragmatist where it's
1208860	1213540	what works is considered true and he says that the communist version of the marxist
1213540	1219220	version of truth is closest to the pragmatist it's what works but it has to also be in line
1219220	1225780	with theory in other words it is action praxis in which doctrine is imminent so here we are
1225780	1230980	we're not even through the first sentence and it's obvious that fascism is the same
1230980	1237220	formulation of communism that is same in kind different in degree in other words another
1237220	1242420	way to phrase that would be two branches same tree like all sound political conceptions
1242420	1248780	fascism is action and it is thought action in which doctrine is imminent and doctrine
1248780	1254640	arising from a given system of historical forces in which it is inserted and working
1254640	1264920	on them from within ps guys that's exactly the same idea in communism that is exactly
1264920	1269640	the same idea there's these historical forces where a part of them those historical forces
1269640	1276080	determine the necessary framework of our doctrine for a utilitarian uh application in order
1276080	1280600	to gain power in order to be able to do our action and our action is going to be reflective
1280600	1286640	against the doctrine and our doctrine is going to be reflective against the the the
1286640	1291880	action in its results in the world because it's a scientific conception a mechanistic
1291880	1298720	conception of how politics should work mussolini there then says it therefore has a form correlated
1298720	1304800	to contingencies of time and space yet again we're seeing same in kind different in degree
1304800	1308800	the marxists in particular the postmodernists that came right after this were very much
1308800	1312940	so interested in saying that everything's contingent to time and space but marx himself
1312940	1318560	was very interested in pointing out that politics is completely contingent to time and space
1318560	1322960	this isn't about universal ideals so don't let the people pushing this fascist shit on
1322960	1327920	the right tell you it's about universal morals and principles it therefore has a form correlated
1327920	1333900	to contingencies of time and space in other words that the means justify the ends the
1333900	1337940	ends being that these people get to have power and repel their enemies the means justify
1337940	1345440	the ends says but it also has an ideal content it's idealist just like communism communism
1345440	1352680	is the it's like the the the the i'm picturing like a cell doing a cell division like from
1352680	1360340	biology slides or whatever it's like or or like saturn disgorging like having a birth
1360340	1367600	out of its own side or whatever from myth from mythology it's communism is giving birth
1367600	1372320	to this bastard child called fascism it's the same thing same in kind but different
1372320	1377300	in degree mussolini says it also has an ideal content which makes it an expression of truth
1377300	1385440	in the higher region of the history of thought that's exactly the same thing that we hear
1385440	1390320	from the communists okay i'm not saying that fascism communism were the same by the way
1390320	1396480	they're not they're not fascism is actually the degenerate child of communism as degenerate
1396480	1402980	as communism is pretending to be virtuous it's wearing the false mantle of virtue in
1402980	1407260	the sense of being like almost an anti-christ but here we have a footnote actually there
1407260	1412480	are a couple but i've skipped some and this is mussolini message for the year first of
1412480	1423080	october message for the year one october 27 1930 that he gave in milan he said today
1423080	1429780	i hold that fascism as an idea a doctrine a realization is universal it is italian in
1429780	1435420	its particular institutions but it is universal in the spirit nor could it be otherwise yet
1435420	1440360	again you see the child of the communist thinking they have the one universal science of how
1440360	1446520	all humans relations actually work it is universal to everybody but it arises in particulars
1446520	1451680	and the particulars are held in opposition to the universal and we see how the how the
1451680	1456000	particulars are actually just a part of a greater whole blah blah blah it's the same
1456000	1462520	model and of course it's also like mystically inevitable because it is universal in the
1462520	1468960	spirit nor could it be otherwise the spirit is universal by reason of its nature therefore
1468960	1474140	anyone may foresee a fascist europe drawing inspiration for her institutions from the
1474140	1480080	doctrine and practice of fascism europe in other words giving a fascist turned solution
1480080	1485200	of problems which beset the modern state the 20th century state which is very different
1485200	1490600	from the states existing before 1789 by the way i did some legwork to make sure because
1490600	1495560	two things happened in 1789 we have the american constitution but we also have the beginning
1495560	1500560	of the french revolution he's talking about the french revolution french revolution is
1500560	1508160	in the dialectical space as well turns out that that's the model of esoteric tyranny
1508160	1517080	that has plagued mankind since 1789 and really before posing as though it's some kind of
1517080	1522680	liberal advancement in in society which it is not it says and the states formed immediately
1522680	1528360	after the french revolution today fascism fills universal requirements fascism solves
1528360	1534240	the threefold problem of relations between state and individual between state and associations
1534240	1542840	between associations and organized associations so that's that's a footnote remark there about
1542840	1549600	what fascism is and to put the point on the fact that it has ideal content which makes
1549600	1553760	it an expression of truth in the higher region of the history of thought as mussolini had
1553760	1559040	it continuing with mussolini's doctrine there is no way of exercising a spiritual influence
1559040	1564280	in the world as a human will dominating the will of others unless one has a conception
1564280	1570360	of both the transient and the specific reality on which that action is to be exercised and
1570360	1576280	of the permanent and universal reality in which the transient dwells and has its being
1576280	1584700	so yet again we're seeing this idealism permeating the entire story but the point now is exercising
1584700	1590740	a spiritual influence on them in the world as a human will dominating the will of others
1590740	1599200	so what the the whole point is literally a will to power for fascism it's throwing off
1599200	1604280	the pretenses of liberation so what you have is with communism that's obviously it's got
1604280	1608960	a pretense to liberation but it obviously wants to remind people who they really are as socialists
1608960	1613700	fascism is like no no no no we're not going to do that we're not no more pretenses of liberation
1613700	1617680	what we're actually going to do is we're going to dominate the will of others because we understand
1617680	1622240	better it's very clearly saying that exercising spiritual influence in the world is a human will
1622240	1626880	dominating the will of others and to do that you have to have a conception both of the transient
1626880	1632440	and the specific reality on which the action is to be exercised and of the permanent and universal
1632440	1636760	reality in which the transient dwells and has its being which they of course believe they know and
1636760	1641520	nobody else knows so that's why they have to have this complete dominating authoritarian power in
1641520	1649000	fact totalitarian power as we'll hear to know men Mussolini tells us one must know man and to know
1649000	1653920	man one must be acquainted with reality and its laws so of course they know these better than
1653920	1658760	everybody this is what you hear from our stupid right right now as well there can be no conception
1658760	1664560	of the state which is not fundamentally a conception of life philosophy or intuition
1664560	1671200	system of ideas evolving within the framework of logic or concentrated in a vision or a faith but
1671200	1678720	always at least potentially an organic conception of the world he then goes on to explain that in
1678720	1685360	fact fascism is based on a spiritual view of life it is a religion and the god of that religion is
1685360	1689880	the state I mentioned earlier I never finished the thought because here we are it's me how are
1689880	1700720	you doing happy new year that that where communism sees the state as in the position of Christ in the
1700720	1705720	Christian Trinity what I think we're gonna hear is that fascism sees the position of the state in
1705720	1711160	the position of God the Father so it's not the self-sacrificial son the fascist state has no
1711200	1718800	intention whatsoever of sacrificing itself it is going to rule eternally and it holds itself up
1718800	1724000	more in the position of the father than the son and so it is a perversion an inversion of the
1724000	1731400	holiness of God posing as you know supreme holiness obviously and so it's a spiritual view of life
1731400	1736360	here's what what Mussolini has to say about it thus many of the practical expressions of fascism
1736360	1741520	such as party organization system of education and discipline can only be understood when
1741520	1747680	considered in relation to its general attitude toward life which is a spiritual attitude and in
1747680	1756520	a footnote which quotes a number of different speeches that he gave in 1930 and 1926 looks
1756520	1764600	like in 1929 all of which seemed to have taken place in Milan I'll read these three quotes the
1764600	1769480	political process is flanked by a philosophic process if it be true that matter was on the
1769480	1775600	altars for one century today it is the spirit which takes its place all manifestations peculiar
1775600	1780360	to the democratic spirit are consequently repudiated easygoing this improvisation the
1780360	1785320	lack of a personal sense of responsibility the exaltation of numbers and of that mysterious
1785320	1792800	divinity called the people all creations of the spirit starting with that religious I'm assuming
1792800	1799240	with the religious are coming to the fore and nobody dare keep up the attitude of anti-clerical
1799240	1804680	ism which for several decades was a favorite with democracy in the Western world by saying
1804680	1810120	that God is returning we mean that spiritual values are returning okay so what's he talking
1810120	1814880	about well we can guess that he's talking about kind of the Weimar situation that everything is
1814880	1820680	getting very decadent this was in 1930 through the 1920s the liberal democracy experiment was
1820680	1825440	failed it turned into this decadence it turned into this mess and you have people in this kind
1825440	1832520	of having this quasi mysterious divinity of the people that has a democratic will and what that
1832520	1837520	has led to is a deletion of spiritual values listen to how similar this sounds to the stuff
1837520	1843080	we're facing today and so now it's time for God to return through the fascists of course by saying
1843080	1846520	that God is returning we mean that spiritual values are returning so with this footnote what
1846520	1851400	we're seeing is the color that the fascist view of life as a spiritual attitude is in fact one
1851400	1855880	where spiritual values God is returning spiritual values are returning so that sounds like it might
1855880	1861760	be okay except what we're also going to discover is that for the fascists state the state itself
1861760	1870840	is God not not some transcendent deity that it nods to in order to cover itself it's again it's
1870840	1877560	an inversion of genuine religion and in 1927 there's another quote in this footnote it's
1877560	1882400	multiple quotes in one footnote he says there's a field reserved more to meditation upon the
1882400	1888880	supreme ends of life than to a research upon these ends consequently science starts from experience
1888880	1894040	but breaks out fatally into philosophy and in my opinion philosophy alone can enlighten science and
1894040	1899200	lead to the universal idea so we're here again talking about what is the universal idea this is
1899200	1903320	the Gnostic conception that these platonic thinkers can somehow figure out what the true
1903320	1908440	universal idea is and then use not just science but science has to transform into philosophy but
1908440	1913440	no no no no no no no that's not right philosophy alone can enlighten science and lead to the
1913440	1918720	universal idea in other words just like with communism they have the idea that they actually
1918720	1924680	understand the true nature of reality and that science has to bend to their true understanding
1924680	1930320	of reality it gets the whole relationship upside down in exactly the same way as Plato in fact
1930320	1936700	what you see with fascism is an attempt to recover the the Platonic Republic from the
1936700	1943480	Marxist inversion of the Platonic Republic Marxists want to create the Platonic Republic upside down
1943480	1949680	with them in charge and the hoi polloi elevates the top to fall to the bottom and be ruled over
1949840	1956160	the fascists are just just doing away with the pretense and they're saying now it's all that's
1956160	1961520	you can't turn the the pyramid of society upside down it's just going to collapse and so that's not
1961520	1965160	going to work and so what we're going to do is we're going to recover the platonic view and so
1965160	1970480	we as the philosopher kings can alone enlighten science in other words tell the science what the
1970480	1975440	right answers to the science are kind of like with kovat or with their spiritual values or
1975440	1980680	whatever in order for us to approach the universal idea which they believe that they have an inkling
1980680	1984880	of that nobody else gets to have so they get to rule with an iron fist in a totalitarian state
1984880	1991480	speaking in 29 Mussolini added in order to understand the fascist movement one must first
1991480	1996720	appreciate the underlying spiritual phenomenon in all its vastness and depth see they are the true
1996720	2002040	spiritualists here the manifestations of the movement have been a power of a powerful and
2002040	2007520	decisive nature but one should go further in point of fact Italian fascism has not only been
2007520	2012240	a political revolt against weak and incapable governments who had allowed state authority to
2012240	2017200	decay and were threatening to arrest the progress of the country but also a spiritual revolt against
2017200	2023080	old ideas which had corrupted the sacred principles of religion of faith of country fascism therefore
2023080	2030480	has been a revolt of the people does this not a sound like what's happening today on the so-called
2030720	2036960	new right or dissident right but also be a lot like communism it is in fact it's a spiritual
2036960	2042080	revolt against old ideas that had corrupted we need new ideas the fascist ideas and those
2042080	2048400	fascist ideas are gonna be based off of a idol built out of religion faith and country in fact
2048400	2053840	that's what fascism does it holds up instead of it claims that it's that's centered on God but
2053840	2058560	it's centered on the state which is holds up the sacred principles of religion of faith and of
2058560	2062520	country but really what it does is it constructs an idol out of these things and forces people to
2062520	2070480	worship it so those that footnote aside Mussolini explains fascism sees in the world not just those
2070480	2077200	superficial material aspects in which man appears as an individual yet again same and kind different
2077200	2082360	in degree from communism man appears as an individual he's not really one standing by
2082360	2087920	himself self-centered subject to natural law which instinctively urges him toward a life of selfish
2088000	2093520	momentary pleasure oh my god that's exactly what the dissident right says all the time now classical
2093520	2100240	liberalism atomizes people it leads them to be self-centered subject to natural law but ignoring
2100240	2104720	it so he's instinctively urged towards selfish momentary pleasure what do you how many more
2104720	2109200	fucking times do i have to hear Jordan Peterson say he didn't stick something he doesn't he
2110720	2117600	shut up jesus christ it sees not only the individual but the nation and the country
2118880	2125200	individuals and generations bound together by a moral law with common traditions and a mission
2125200	2130960	which suppressing the instinct for life closed in a brief circle of pleasure builds up a higher life
2131520	2137520	founded on duty a life free from the limitations of time and space in which the individual by
2137520	2143600	self-sacrifice the renunciation of self-interest by death itself can achieve that purely spiritual
2143600	2152080	existence in which his value as a man consists so fascism is that you get to build up a higher life
2152080	2156400	around what death itself it's a fucking death cult i don't know how many times we have to
2156400	2160960	point these things out why because it's the bastard child of communism it is the same in
2160960	2165600	kind but different in degree of course it's another death cult but through self-sacrifice
2165600	2170320	and the renunciation of self-interest in other words you have to break your own will and give
2170320	2175680	it over to the higher will which is incorporated literally that's the word for it here by the way
2175680	2182800	corporate incorporated in the fascist state which is held up as a kind of idol idol or god to be
2182800	2189520	worshipped he says this concept is therefore a spiritual one concept of fascism arising from
2189520	2195360	the general reaction of the century against the materialistic positivism of the 19th century
2196320	2201040	so there's where we're seeing the Weimar phenomenon everything got materialistic it got
2201040	2207840	decadent and we're gonna get very austere now anti-positivistic but positive neither skeptical
2207840	2216160	nor agnostic hmm neither pessimistic nor supinely optimistic as are generally speaking the doctrines
2216160	2221920	all negative which place the center of life outside man oh it's a man-centered religion
2222720	2229200	whereas by the exercise of his free will man can and must create his own world just like in
2229200	2236240	communism man becomes his own creator the creator of his own world this is i guess if we're gonna
2236240	2242720	just stick with that term idolatry this is same in kind different in degree from fascism or from
2242720	2247840	communism so fascism is the negation or antithesis of communism which means that
2247920	2254000	dialectically speaking the goal is going to be to let them clash in violent collision so that
2254000	2259440	you can pick up the pieces and synthesize them into a greater whole which is a totalitarian
2259440	2267040	system that works see fascism can produce and it has the discipline of the people and a
2267040	2275200	distributist model however it's very unfair so you need an equity and sustainability-minded approach
2275200	2281120	that's brought in from the other side from the communistic side the degrowth side the you know
2281120	2287120	the equity and inclusion model this is this they're going to be synthesized so when we bend
2287120	2291680	when we see a fascist or sorry when we see a communist provocation and we see a fascist
2291680	2296800	reaction you can damn well bet that the goal is that they have the same overarching system in
2296800	2302160	place and those are going to eventually be mixed and so we sell out our freedom we throw away our
2302160	2308160	liberty in the name of trying to gain security against this provocation the communist provocation
2308160	2314880	and when we do what we actually do is set the stage for the bastard child of communism to
2314880	2321200	come into power and then mate with communism itself and create a bastard grandchild which is
2321760	2325680	the system that they want to install which is ultimately this distributive system where they
2325680	2331120	get to decide who gets what and who does what work that's what he's talking about and man must
2331120	2337040	create his own world that's at the center of the fascist idolatry fascism he says this is
2337040	2342720	Mussolini again fascism wants man to be active and to engage in action with all his energies
2343280	2348400	it wants him to be manfully aware of the difficulties besetting him and ready to face them
2349520	2357760	so in our time we see this huge destruction of masculinity and so the fascist rhetoric fits
2357760	2363760	right into that will it fit right into it back then too fascism conceives of life as a struggle
2363760	2369200	in which it behooves a man to win for himself a really worthy place first of all by fitting himself
2369200	2375600	physically morally and intellectually to become the implement required for winning it so we're
2375600	2380080	not going to fight through class identification as in communism we're going to fight through becoming
2380640	2388320	a super soldier basically and fitting into a soldier unit which actually is given later in
2388320	2394400	this description so just like communism but different it doesn't see the life in terms of
2394400	2400640	class struggle it sees life in terms of intrinsic struggle so those who can rise to the top the best
2401760	2407760	deserve to be on top so as i've said before where communism says oppression is the problem and we
2407760	2414000	alone can end it fascism says no no actually oppression is how we got good and we should do
2414000	2419840	a lot more of it as for the individual it says so for the nation this is mussolini as for the
2419840	2426720	individual so for the nation and so for mankind hence the high value of culture in all its forms
2426720	2432240	artistic religious scientific this is one of the reasons i'm really uncomfortable with these
2432240	2437760	accounts these propaganda accounts on social media posing like look at what high culture
2437760	2443920	could be again it's creating this vision of a romantic vision of the past that inspires this
2443920	2449920	fascistic mindset and the outstanding importance of education well we all know what actually the
2449920	2454880	fascist did with education was that they used the prussian schooling model to create um
2455760	2462400	little automatons uh not that much differently from what mao did and what the soviets did
2463760	2470320	so that's not that good hence also the essential value of work by which man subjugates nature and
2470320	2475840	creates the human world economic political ethical and intellectual again we see same
2475840	2482640	and kind different and degree from uh communism and we see reflections of exactly what the so
2483280	2487920	called new right thinks is a great idea now we really need to be thinking more carefully about
2487920	2493600	what we're dealing with and our responses to the circumstances that were put in through this huge
2493600	2499840	global communist provocation we're facing right now so there are a couple footnotes this one is
2500480	2506000	headed as the positive conception of life as struggle so fascism holds a positive conception
2506000	2512800	of life as struggle and here's what mussolini had to say on that topic um in 1920 um in this
2512800	2520000	case in trieste and he said struggle is at the origin of all things for life is full of contrasts
2520000	2525760	there is love and hatred white and black day and night good and evil and until these contrasts
2525760	2532320	achieve balance struggle faithfully remains at the root of human nature so this is ultimately the
2532320	2538480	hermetic polarity model that just like communism uses the idea is that there's these contrasts
2538480	2542800	there's distinctions and they are in conflict with one another struggle between them
2545520	2552160	however he says it is good for it to be so so this is where i said that fascism doesn't say
2552160	2555920	that these things are bad and should be transcended it says no these things are good and should be
2555920	2562240	elevated today we can indulge in wars economic battles conflicts of ideas but if a day came
2562240	2567920	to pass when struggle ceased to exist that day would be tinged with melancholy it would be a day
2567920	2575760	of ruin the day of ending but that ever discloses new horizons by attempting to restore calm peace
2575760	2582400	tranquility or a would-be fighting the tendencies of the sorry or a would-be fighting the tendencies
2582400	2588560	of the present period of dynamism or we must prepare be prepared for other struggles and for
2588560	2594560	other surprises peace will only come when people surrender to a christian dream of universal
2594560	2601920	brotherhood when they can hold out hands across the ocean and over the mountains and then that
2601920	2605920	sounds really great because it's nodding toward christianity and then what does mussolini say
2605920	2612160	personally i do not believe very much in these idealisms but i do not exclude them for i exclude
2612160	2618400	nothing so he doesn't really believe in it but we'll hold it up as an emblem because he's building
2618640	2625120	an idol in the state he goes on in his doctrine to explain this positive conception of life is
2625120	2630960	obviously an ethical one it invests the whole field of reality as well as the human activities
2630960	2637360	which master it no action is exempt from moral judgment no activity can be despoiled of the value
2637360	2642640	which a moral purpose confers on all things therefore life conceived of by the fascist
2643280	2649040	is serious austere and religious that's what the new right seems to think we all want to
2649040	2652960	have even though we also all know that they're kind of decadent behind the scenes and complete
2652960	2659680	jerks all its manifestations are poised in a world sustained by moral forces and subject
2659680	2666400	to spiritual responsibilities the fascist disdains an easy life so that's again
2667360	2675280	kind of this same in kind different degree from communism it's actually the picture of throwing
2675280	2679040	off the illusion of communism so communism has this illusion that we're all going to have a life
2679040	2683680	of liberated leisure fascism's like no no no we're not we're going to all work and miserable toil
2683680	2688240	forever and in lots of conflict and struggle there will never be harmony and if there was
2688240	2695600	we'd be sad about it now there's a footnote here that's headed fascism's ethical conception
2695600	2701920	and he says i called the organization fasci italiani de combatimento this hard metallic
2701920	2708400	name comprised the whole program of fascism as i dreamed it now listen to how he addresses his
2708400	2716880	people this is him in 1932 in a talk titled we're against easy life okay so i'm gonna read some of
2716880	2723680	that part again this is this hard metallic name fasci italiani de combatimento this hard metallic
2723680	2729920	name comprised the whole program of fascism as i dreamed it and then he says comrades comrades
2732000	2741920	comrades this is still our program fight life for the fascist is a continuous ceaseless fight
2741920	2748160	which we accept with ease with great courage with the necessary intrepidity
2748160	2756400	you touch the core of fascist philosophy he says when a recent when recently a finnish
2756400	2761040	philosopher asked me to expound to him the significance of fascism in one sentence i wrote
2761600	2770560	in german we are against the easy life in his doctrine he writes the fascist conception of
2770560	2777200	life is a religious one in which man is viewed in his imminent relation to a higher law
2777840	2782960	endowed with an objective will transcending the individual and raising him to conscious
2782960	2789840	membership of a spiritual society those who perceive nothing beyond opportunistic
2789840	2795680	considerations in the religious policy of the fascist regime fail to realize that fascism is
2795680	2802880	not only a system of government but also and above all a system of thought and the footnote
2802880	2809040	on the religious conception of fascism quotes again from milan mussolini saying in 1930
2809040	2814320	if fascism were not a creed how could it endow its followers with courage and stoicism
2815040	2820240	only a creed which has soared to the heights of religion can inspire such words as past the lips
2820240	2829360	now lifeless alas of frederico florio it's a religion fascism is a religion a religion of
2829360	2835520	what well it's a religion of the fascist state as it turns out based on the idea of conflict
2835520	2843040	and a positive conception of itself through constant ceaseless struggle austerity severity
2844080	2848240	i wonder why it doesn't work in the end wonder why people get so dissatisfied and get so upset
2848240	2852320	with it and then you end up handing over all the authority to the left fascism is not an
2852320	2857600	answer to communism it is the next stage of stalled communism on its way to the true
2857600	2864000	implementation of communism when communism stalls fascism arises when fascism arises
2865520	2872240	it sets the preconditions necessary to move into the new form of actually existing socialism and
2872240	2877120	we see this again and again through history it is not an answer even though it speaks
2878320	2882800	in an idolatrous way toward what look like important pieces of the answer for example
2882800	2888640	the next section of this document is titled the importance of tradition yes in fact tradition is
2888640	2895600	important yes in fact communists destroy tradition yes in fact that is a positive direction to point
2895600	2900480	to to pay attention to because tradition is in fact an ex a kind of codification of experiments
2900480	2907680	upon what has worked in the past which is valuable however we're going to turn it into
2907680	2915200	an idol if we're fascists what does Mussolini say in the fascist conception of history man is man
2915200	2920480	only by virtue of the spiritual process to which he contributes as a member of the family the
2920480	2926800	social group the nation and in function of history to which all nations bring their contribution
2927440	2933520	hence the great value of tradition and records and language and customs in the rules of social life
2933520	2943200	outside history man is a non-entity that's what that's what he had to say that's what Mussolini
2943200	2948800	had to say about tradition that's it there's a footnote here where we get a quote from his
2948800	2954080	speech in Milan from 1930 again tradition certainly is one of the greatest spiritual
2954080	2958960	forces of a people in as much as it is successive and constant creation of their soul
2959440	2964160	so that's on the historical and realistic conception allegedly of fascism as compared
2964160	2969920	to other doctrines so i just want to kind of go back to that part though outside history
2969920	2976480	man is a non-entity but fascism has the same view of history roughly that communism has which is
2976480	2982960	that history is this kind of productive capacity of man and creating and telling his own story
2982960	2990800	and only within that are you even an entity so your role is to contribute to what to the
2990800	2995760	grand movement of history which is exactly what the class conflict in communism is about
2995760	3001840	except this is different because it's a rejection of that in in the dialectical way in communism
3001840	3006880	the classes are to awaken to a class consciousness to realize that they are historical movers and
3006880	3013440	take part in their contribution to the movement of history toward an arc of liberation in fascism
3013440	3021040	you are to awaken to your consciousness as a member of the bound together unified state and
3021040	3025840	make your contribution toward the bending of history toward whatever the hell the fascist
3025840	3030800	think lies at the end of it which is not exactly clear because it seems to be relentlessly fighting
3030800	3037440	uh it's actually imperialism i think if we get further down so the next section is titled
3037440	3043840	rejection of individualism and the importance of the state and i should add just uh parenthetically
3043840	3051040	that the subject headings here were added by the curators of this website not by Mussolini so he
3051040	3055680	didn't he just wrote the doctrine this subject heading rejection of individualism and the
3055680	3060400	importance of the state is the summary of this next section and what Mussolini had to say about
3060400	3065440	it is fascism is therefore opposed to all individualistic abstractions based on 18th
3065440	3071840	century century materialism it is opposed to all Jacobinistic utopias and innovations so it's
3071840	3078640	against liberalism and it's against uh communism Jacobins are the precursors really to the communist
3078640	3082880	so we can just say that that's roughly the same thing that's the french social contract idea
3083680	3088160	it does not believe in the possibility of happiness on earth as conceived by the
3088160	3093840	economist literature of the 18th century in other words Thomas Jefferson's idea of life
3093840	3100240	liberty and the pursuit of happiness and uh John Locke's conceptions of pursuing happiness and many
3100240	3107280	of the uh English enlightenment's views of the value of pursuing a life worth living those are
3107280	3113600	out in fascism it rejects that it does not believe in the possibility of happiness or even the smiles
3113600	3119760	of heaven as it was sometimes phrased on earth as conceived by the economistic literature of
3119760	3124400	the 19th century and it therefore rejects the theological notion that at some future time the
3124400	3130800	human family will secure a final settlement of all its difficulties in fascism war is forever
3131360	3136880	this notion runs over sorry this notion runs counter to experience which teaches that life
3136880	3143760	is in continual flux and is uh sorry is in continual flux and in process of evolution
3144320	3151040	in politics fascism aims at realism in practice it desires to deal only with those problems
3151040	3157520	which are the spontaneous product of historic conditions and which find or suggest their own
3157520	3164400	solutions so i urge you once again to realize that fascism is not a solution to communism it is the
3164400	3172480	same thing same in kind different in degree they are two branches of the same tree the footnote
3172480	3179120	here reads uh here quoting several uh different uh pieces from it looks like another speech he
3179120	3185600	gave in Milan in 1930 our temperament leads us to appraise the concrete aspect of problems rather
3185600	3191600	than their ideological or mystical sublimation therefore we easily regain our balance our battle
3191600	3198000	is an ungrateful one yet it is a beautiful battle since it compels us to count only upon our own
3198000	3205040	forces revealed truths have torn to sorry revealed truths we have torn to shreds so much for your
3205040	3211920	religion i guess dogmas we have spat upon we have rejected all theories of paradise we have baffled
3211920	3218240	charlatans white red black charlatans who placed miraculous drugs on the market to give a happiness
3218880	3226160	to mankind we do not believe in program and plans and saints or apostles above all we believe not in
3226160	3232800	happiness in salvation or in the promised land we do not believe in a single solution be it
3232800	3238880	economical political or moral a linear solution of the problems of life because of illustrate
3238880	3245200	illustrious choristers from all of the sacri i don't think that this is a real word
3245200	3252400	sacristies that's got to be a mistype sorry because of the elusive choristers because of
3252400	3258480	illustrious choristers from all the sacristies life is not linear and never can be reduced to
3258480	3266240	a segment traced by primordial needs only by entering into the process of reality this is back
3266240	3270480	in the doctrine by the way one sentence and another footnote from milan only by entering
3270480	3274800	into the process of reality and taking possession of the forces at work within it can man act on
3274800	3281920	nature sorry can man act on man and on nature i really butchered a very important sentence
3281920	3286000	let me read the whole sentence again after reminding you that that's what mark said the
3286000	3291600	point of man's act life activity is is to work on man and nature to bring out his true nature
3291600	3296400	so for the communist it is that you are a socialist that is going to live in perfect
3296400	3300560	harmony in your perfectly creative environment for the fascist is that you are going to be
3301200	3308480	a socialist who works in perfect harmony with the state apparatus that actually makes socialism work
3309760	3316960	oh but he says only by entering into the process of reality just like communism and taking
3316960	3320720	possession of the forces at work within it we don't call that seizing the means of production
3320720	3326800	here i guess can man act on man and on nature that's exactly the same program as communism with
3326880	3331040	different ends same in kind different in degree it's a dialectical antithesis
3331040	3336240	of communism and therefore it is meant to synthesize or blend with communism into one
3336240	3342480	coherent system on the other side of the reaction after a tremendous conflict we should not be
3342480	3346800	supporting this and we should not be supporting people who are supporting this the footnote here
3346800	3352400	to that particularly interesting very communistic sentence is we are not and do not wish to be
3352400	3357840	motionless mummies with faces perpetually turned toward the same horizon nor do we wish to shut
3357840	3362400	ourselves up within the narrow hedges of subversive bigotry where formulas like
3362400	3368000	prayer of a professed religion are muttered mechanically we are men living men who wish
3368000	3374160	to give our contribution however modest to the creation of history we uphold moral and
3374160	3380880	traditional values which socialism neglects or despises but above all fascism has a horror
3380880	3387520	of anything implying an arbitrary mortgage on the mysterious future in spite of the theories
3387520	3392560	of conservation and renovation of tradition and progress expounded by the right and the left
3392560	3399120	we do not cling desperately to the past as as to a last board of salvation yet we do not dash
3399120	3406320	headlong into the seductive mists of the future negation eternal immobility mean damnation
3406320	3414320	i am all for motion i am one who marches on this is fascism so in his doctrine he goes on
3414320	3419360	again a short piece before another footnote anti-individualistic the fascist conception of
3419360	3424640	life stresses the importance of the state see it's holding up the state as a religious idol
3424640	3429680	it is anti-individualistic your goal is not to merge with the class as in communism it is to
3429680	3439040	merge with the state overall which is ultimately what happens at the end of communism and then the
3439040	3444400	state goes away and communism but the state persists so the self-sacrificial christ state
3444400	3451040	and communism is replaced by the eternally enduring god the father state in fascism
3451040	3457200	it's just another idol though anti-individualistic so you aren't you you're just part of the state
3457200	3461520	the fascist conception of life stresses the importance of the state and accepts the individual
3462080	3467680	only insofar as his interests coincide with those of the state which stands for the conscience and
3467680	3475360	the universal will of man as a historic entity so the state is your conscience the state is your
3475360	3483760	universal state of being that is what you must remember you are you are a part of a cog within
3483760	3491280	the fascist state and your individuality is not welcome we must not support the people
3491280	3497120	supporting fascism as though it's a solution to the problems america face faces it is to throw
3497120	3504000	america away in order to try to save america the footnote here is headed the individual and liberty
3504960	3512080	and here we have a conference in milan that's being quoted from 1929 we were the first to
3512080	3518960	state in the face of demo liberal individualism that the individual exists only insofar as he is
3518960	3525280	within the state and subjected to the requirements of the state and that as civilization assumes
3525280	3530240	aspects which grow more and more complicated individual freedoms becomes more and more
3530240	3538560	restricted exactly the same model he says that we're not going to reject 1789 meaning the french
3538560	3543520	revolution of course he doesn't want to reject russo's social contract program this is exactly
3543520	3547840	what he's articulating individual freedom becomes more and more restricted we could quote from
3547840	3553200	max horkheimer explaining that freedom and justice are dialectical concepts the more of one you have
3553200	3562400	the less of the other oh same thing here so the individual exists only insofar as he is within
3562400	3566800	the state so the human's true nature that the fascist understands in a gnostic way is that
3566800	3571680	you are a cog within the state and so you must be subjected to the requirements of that state
3573120	3577760	and as the civilization assumes aspects which grow more and more complicated think of how
3577760	3583440	complicated life is now individual freedom becomes more and more restricted this is exactly the shit
3583440	3588560	we hear from the world economic forum all the time by the way and this is what we hear from the tradd
3588560	3593280	right this new right or dissident right or whatever where they want to start restricting
3593280	3597280	more and more freedom because people are doing it wrong and we can't possibly have freedom because
3597280	3601600	freedom leads to atomization and conflict and blah blah blah and that's what really gave rise
3601600	3605920	to communism in the first place which is not true what we're seeing is the same in kind but
3605920	3613280	different in degree it is the reaction to communism but he goes on here in his speech 29 29 in milan
3613280	3618480	he says the state sorry the sense of the state grows within the consciousness of Italians for
3618480	3623680	they feel that the state alone is the irreplaceable safeguard of their unit and independence
3625200	3631200	that the state alone represents continuity into the future of their stock and their history sounds
3631200	3636480	very much like an idol it's like moses coming down from the mountain and they've got the golden
3636480	3642880	calf there but the golden calf is a state and moses calls over and says what have you done and
3642880	3646640	the guy's like i don't know we just took all the gold and we threw it in the fire and out came this
3646640	3654080	state that we're all a part of now it's straight idolatry now we switch to another speech in this
3654080	3661520	part of the footnote from 1928 also in milan and we'll go back to the 1921 or 29 one in the next
3661520	3667760	part it says if in the course of the last eight years we have made such astounding progress you
3667760	3674480	may well think and suppose and foresee that in the course of the next 50 or 80 years the onward
3674480	3681360	trend of italy of this italy we feel to be so powerful so full of vital fluid yuk will be really
3681360	3690400	grandiose it will be so especially if concord lasts among citizens ps it didn't if the state
3690400	3697360	continues to be the sole arbiter arbitrator sorry in political and social conflicts if all remains
3697360	3703280	within the state and nothing outside the state if all remains within the state nothing outside the
3703280	3709440	state if all remains within god and nothing outside of god the state is an idol in fascism
3709440	3714800	because it is impossible to conceive any individual existing outside the state unless he be
3714800	3724000	a savage whose home is in the solitude of the sandy desert and then coming back to 1929 a year
3724000	3729520	later he said fascism has restored to the state its sovereign functions by claiming its absolute
3729520	3735120	ethical meaning against the egotism of classes and categories to the government of the state
3735120	3740640	which was reduced to a mere instrument of electoral assemblies it has restored dignity
3740640	3746400	as representing the personality of the state and its power of empire it has rescued state
3746400	3753840	administration from the weight of factions and party interests so back to the doctrine the first
3753840	3758720	half of this by the way has tons of footnotes and then the second half doesn't fascism mussolini
3758720	3764720	tells us is opposed to classical liberalism let's be real clear about that sounds like today
3764720	3769760	fascism is opposed to classical liberalism which arose as a reaction to absolutism
3769760	3774720	and exhausted its historical function when the state became the expression of the conscience
3774720	3782320	and will of the people liberalism denied the state in the name of the individual fascism reasserts
3782320	3788320	the rights of the state as expressing the real is the real essence of the individual so did you get
3788320	3794480	that here's the intrinsic conflict liberalism denies the state and the name of the individual
3794480	3799840	that's why it's actually the answer to communism that's not what fascism says fascism reasserts the
3799840	3805520	rights of the state as expressing the real essence of the individual the individual the person you
3805520	3816000	your true human nature is a piece of the state that's fascism and in a footnote from uh may 1929
3816080	3821600	in milan he says let no one think of denying the moral character of fascism i will deny the moral
3821600	3826720	character of fascism actually you motherfucker let no one think of denying the moral character
3826720	3831280	of fascism for i should be ashamed to speak from this tribune if i did not feel that i represent
3831280	3837360	the moral and spiritual powers of the state what would the state be if it did not possess a spirit
3837360	3842960	of its own and a morality of its own which lend power to the laws in virtue of which the state
3842960	3848720	is obeyed by its citizens the fascist state claims its ethical character it is catholic
3848720	3856000	but above all it is fascist it's an idol in fact it is exclusively and essentially
3856000	3862720	fascist catholicism completes fascism in this we openly declare but let no one think they can turn
3862720	3867200	the tables on us under cover of metaphysics or philosophy so if you think this is really about
3867200	3871600	your religion you are dead wrong you know the state is going to replace your religion
3871600	3875280	all you stupid trad caths thinking this is a good idea you need to stop
3877520	3882880	it is catholic but above all it is fascist in fact it is exclusively and essentially fascist
3883440	3886640	don't let anybody think they can turn the tables on us you're not going to
3887440	3893520	under the cover of metaphysics or philosophy he says that uh fascism is a state which is fully
3893520	3898720	aware of its mission and represents a people which are marching on a state which is which
3898720	3905600	necessarily transforms the people even in their physical aspect just like communism same and kind
3905600	3910240	different in degree in order to be something more than a mere administrator the state must utter
3910240	3917200	great words expound great ideas and place great problems before the people and so what does he
3917200	3922000	think of liberty in the doctrine he says and if liberty is to be the attribute of living men and
3922000	3927840	not of abstract dummies invented by individualistic liberalism then fascism stands for liberty well
3927840	3933040	there's your dialectical inversion isn't it and for the only liberty worth having having what's
3933040	3939280	the only liberty worth having according to benito mussolini the liberty of the state and of the
3939280	3945760	individual within the state so the footnote here says quoting from a speech in 1924 in milan
3948320	3954080	the vol sorry the concept of freedom is not absolute uh-oh just like the communists uh-oh
3954080	3959920	uh-oh freedom is a dialectical concept because nothing is ever absolute in life freedom is not
3959920	3967920	a right it is a duty it is not a gift it is a conquest it is not equality it is a privilege
3967920	3973360	privilege of what granted by the state this is a complete rejection of the idea that our rights
3973360	3977840	come from god and so any charlatan on the right who says that our rights come from god and then
3977840	3985680	advocates for fascism is a fucking liar got that they're not lying they are a fucking liar
3987360	3995040	got it freedom is a privilege from the deified state that's fascism the concept of freedom
3995040	4000240	changes with the passing of time exactly like communism there is a freedom in times of peace
4000240	4005280	which is not the freedom of times of war there is a freedom in times of prosperity which is not a
4005280	4012640	freedom to be allowed in times of poverty in our state the individual is not deprived of freedom
4012640	4018320	in fact he has greater liberty than an isolated man because the state protects him and he is part
4018320	4024400	of the state isolated man is without defense so in other words you can have a little bit of security
4025360	4030000	and lose your freedom and somehow that becomes greater freedom because now you're protected
4030000	4036480	yeah same scam different day the doctrine another short paragraph before another long footnote
4036480	4041760	the fascist conception of the state is all embracing outside of it no human or spiritual
4041760	4048640	values can exist much less have value did you get that part the fascist conception of the state is
4048640	4058800	all embracing it's the idol outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist outside of the state
4058800	4066560	no human or spiritual values can exist much less have value thus understood fascism is totalitarian
4066560	4072400	that's Mussolini describing his own doctrine right there black and white thus understood
4072400	4080000	fascism is totalitarian and the fascist state a synthesis and unit inclusive of all values
4080000	4087040	interprets develops and potentiates the whole life of a people yet again the fascists are
4087040	4093440	gnostics who figured out that the state is the true nature of man and to be part of the hive
4093440	4099920	of the state is what you have to remember you actually are the footnote says today we may tell
4099920	4106160	the world of the creation of the powerful united state of italy ranging from the alps to sicily
4106160	4111280	this state is expressed by a well-organized centralized unitarian democracy where people
4111280	4115760	circulate at ease indeed gentlemen if you admit the people into the citadel of the state
4115760	4121280	and the people will defend it if you close them out the people will assault it in the
4121280	4126880	fascist regime the unity of classes the political social and choral unity of the italian people is
4126880	4135840	realized within the state and only within the fascist state so the doctrine comes back to say
4135840	4140400	no individuals or groups political parties cultural associations economic unions social
4140400	4147760	classes exist outside of the state this is explained further in a footnote with the heading
4147760	4153600	conception of a cooperative state he says we have created the united state of italy remember that
4153600	4160240	since the empire italy had not been a united state here i wish to reaffirm solemnly our doctrine of
4160240	4166000	the state here i wish to reaffirm affirm with no weaker energy the formula i expounded at the
4166000	4173360	skala in milan everything in the state nothing against the state nothing outside the state
4175040	4181600	is god outside the state no no god is in the state god is part of the state god is
4182320	4190000	subsidiary subsidiary to the state god is out of the picture and the idol of the state is central
4190000	4194640	stop letting these so-called religious people tell you that they're trying to bring back religious
4194640	4201200	and spiritual values in the guise of fascism nothing could be further from true fascism he
4201200	4206160	says back in the doctrine is therefore opposed to socialism to which unity within the state which
4206160	4212560	amalgamates sorry which amalgamates classes into a single economic and ethical reality is unknown
4212560	4218320	so in other words because socialism operates off of a picture of class consciousness and antagonism
4218320	4224160	it doesn't unify the state in one single mass so it's opposed that's the reason fascism is
4224160	4229680	opposed to socialism and which sees in history nothing but class struggle that's another reason
4229680	4234560	that it's opposed to socialism because your goal isn't to be an awakened oppressed class that wants
4234560	4239280	to overthrow the the oppressive chains of society it's to realize that you are part of the oppressive
4239280	4244640	state itself and that your role is to uphold the power of the oppressive state it's exactly like
4244640	4249920	i've been explaining to people for a couple of years now fascism he says is likewise opposed to
4250400	4255760	trade unionism as a class weapon but when brought within the orbit of the state fascism recognizes
4255760	4261040	the real needs that gave rise to socialism and trade unionism giving them due weight in the
4261040	4266080	guild or corporative system in which divergent interests are coordinated and harmonized
4266080	4270960	in the unity of the state and the footnote it says we are in other words a state which controls
4270960	4277280	all forces acting in nature we control political forces we control moral forces we control economic
4277280	4283520	forces therefore we are a full-blown corporative state we stand for a new principle in the world
4283520	4290320	we stand for sheer categorical definitive antithesis to the world of democracy plutocracy
4290320	4296320	freemasonry to the world which still abides by the fundamental principles laid down in 1789
4296880	4301120	which is the french revolution which is not exactly the thing to be holding up as a great
4301120	4306400	program here everything is in the state the state is your idol
4308240	4314640	the ministry of corporations this is back in the actual doctrine is not a bureaucratic organ nor
4314640	4319120	does it wish to exercise the functions of syndical organizations which are necessarily independent
4319120	4324320	since they aim at organizing selecting and improving the members of syndicates the ministry
4324320	4330400	of corporations is an institution in virtue of which in the center and outside integral corporation
4330400	4334880	becomes an accomplished fact where balance is achieved between interests and forces of the
4334880	4341120	economic world this is the Deng Xiaoping model by the way this is that you have a corporative state
4341120	4347920	and then there are corporations that are actually shells of that overarching state that operates in
4347920	4353760	a fascistic subsidiarity way so when you have a state corporation and then the real corporations
4353760	4359040	that do the real production act in concert with the public-private partnership stakeholder
4359040	4365280	capitalism CCP Deng Xiaoping model whatever one you want to pick what you have is fascism
4365280	4370080	you have fascist subsidiarity where the corporations do the will of the state
4370080	4374640	and you say well what's happening isn't communism now because that's what we have here it's fascism
4374640	4378720	that's what's happening in the u.s no no they fused guys they fused they're already together
4378720	4383440	they mixed that was the project of the second half of the 20th century when you try to separate
4383440	4388480	fascism and communism in the world today you're thinking about terms that haven't been relevant
4388480	4394240	since like the 1920s and 1930s that's all obsolete since the 1960s 1970s communism and
4394240	4400080	fascism have fused into a single system as would happen when the thesis and the antithesis are seen
4400080	4406000	together and finally become seen as two pieces of the same puzzle two same and kind different
4406000	4413040	in degree and are synthesized into a single thing and this is what he's describing such a glance is
4413040	4417040	so what the problem is here let me just explain before i go on even though i'm pushing it on my
4417040	4425120	time here what they realize is the fascism can produce sort of but it can't make people happy
4425120	4429680	it can't actually make the people like it's not good it doesn't work it's completely unstable
4429680	4434720	so what they need is a system of distribution that actually mimics the promises of communism
4435360	4441920	and so what they did was they it's fascism for the corporate universe and it's it's uh communism for
4441920	4448400	for the people for the regular people that's the new model this program doesn't actually work it
4448400	4452160	works better than communism but it doesn't work so if you just mix them two together you could
4452160	4456160	have a totalitarian system that works if you want to know what it looks like in practice look at
4456160	4462000	china he says such a glance is possible only within the sphere of the state because the state
4462000	4468800	alone transcends the contrasting interests of groups and individuals not god don't let these
4468880	4474480	people fool you into thinking this is religious it's state religion it's an idol of the state
4475120	4480560	in view of coordinating them to achieve higher aims the achievement of these aims is speeded
4480560	4484560	up by the fact that all economic organizations acknowledged safeguarded and supported by the
4484560	4491200	corporative state exist within the orbit of fascism in other terms they accept the conception
4491200	4498560	of fascism in theory and in practice and it says we have constituted a corporative fascist state
4498560	4504480	to the state of national society a state which concentrates controls harmonizes and tempers the
4504480	4511440	interests of all social classes which are thereby protected in equal measure again safety committee
4511440	4517680	on public safety there's your 1789 thing that's the french revolution being at the center of
4517680	4524400	what's going on here whereas during the years of demo liberal regime labor looked with diffidence
4524400	4529680	upon the state was in fact outside of the state and against the state and considered the state
4529680	4535440	an enemy of every day in every hour there is not one working italian today who does not seek a
4535440	4541360	place in his corporation or federation who does not wish to be a living atom of the great immense
4541360	4547360	living organization which is the national corporate state of fascism imagine that life you
4547360	4552960	get to be part of the big state idol in the doctrine he writes grouped according to their
4552960	4558560	several interests individuals form classes these divergent interests form trade unions when
4558560	4563120	organized according to their several economic activities but first and foremost they form
4563680	4571680	the state which is no mere matter of numbers the sons of so it says sons s-u-n-s here by the way
4571680	4578160	i'm not sure if that's a typo the sons of the individuals forming the majority fascism is
4578160	4583920	therefore opposed to that form of democracy which equates a nation to the majority lowering
4583920	4589360	it to the level of the largest number but it is the purest form of democracy same kinds of
4589360	4594640	lies communism tells if the nation be considered as it should be from the point of view of quality
4594640	4601440	rather than quantity as an idea the mightiest because the most ethical the most coherent the
4601440	4608240	truest expressing itself in a people as the conscience and the will of the few if not indeed
4608240	4614480	of one an ending to express itself in the conscious and conscience and will of the mass
4614480	4620720	of the whole group ethnically molded by natural and historical conditions into a nation advancing
4620720	4626400	as one conscience and one will along the same lines of development and spiritual formation
4627280	4633920	not a race which he notes as a 95% of feeling when he's talking about race not a race nor a
4633920	4639840	geographically defined region but a people historically perpetuating itself a multitude
4639840	4646400	unified by an idea and imbued with the will to live the will to power self-consciousness
4646400	4655360	and personality this is this is fascism right there so it is an ethno state held up as an idol
4655360	4659520	in which everyone has to understand themselves and there is nothing outside of it and it is the
4659520	4667520	basis of your of your religious existence he says in so far as it is embodied in a state this higher
4667520	4672960	personality becomes a nation it is not the nation which generates the state that is an antiquated
4672960	4678720	naturalistic concept which is which afforded a basis for 19th century publicity in favor of
4678720	4684400	national governments rather it is the state which creates the nation connected with the
4684400	4691280	nation conferring volition and therefore real life on a people made aware of their moral unity
4692560	4698560	the right to national independence does not arise from any merely literary and idealistic form of
4698560	4704240	self-consciousness still less from a more or less passive and unconscious de facto situation
4704240	4709840	but from an active self-conscious political will expressing itself in action and ready to prove
4709840	4717760	its rights it arises it arises in short from the existence at least in fieri of a state and d indeed
4717760	4723840	it is the state which has the expression of a universal ethical will creates the right to a
4723840	4729360	to national independence so the state is an expression of universal ethical will it's again
4729360	4737520	it's an idol footnote here long one on the conception of a state mussolini explains a
4737520	4742800	nation exists in as much as it is a people a people rise in as much as they are numerous
4742800	4747680	hard-working and well-regulated power is the outcome of this threefold principle this by the
4747680	4751680	way is the same stuff you hear from the christian nationalist people for example stephen wolf in his
4751680	4757600	book the case for christian nationalism fascism he says does not deny the state fascism maintains
4757600	4764640	that a civic society national or imperial cannot be conceived unless in the form of a state for us
4764640	4770320	the nation is mainly spirit and not only territory there are states which owned immense
4770320	4775760	territories and yet left no trace in the history of mankind neither is it a question of number
4775760	4780320	because there have been in history small microscopic states which left immortal
4780320	4785680	imperishable documents in art and philosophy the greatness of a nation is the compound of all of
4785680	4791600	these virtues and conditions a nation is great when the power of the spirit is translated into
4791600	4796240	reality so just like with the christian trinity that's been perverted and through hagel and
4797120	4802400	inverted through marks and then re-inverted in fascism you see that there's a holy spirit that is
4803200	4808480	flowing forth from the state that embodies the people with their will and their character
4810320	4816000	this is a perverse religion state as the state as an idol that's what fascism is
4816240	4822640	we wish to unify the nation within the sovereign state which is above everyone and can afford to
4822640	4828320	be against everyone since it represents the moral continuity of the nation in history
4828320	4833920	without the state there is no nation there are merely human aggregations subject to all the
4833920	4840480	disintegrations which history may inflict upon them that was him speaking in 24 by the way in
4841280	4846480	milan as well in the doctrine and then we get to the last footnote and we can finally just
4846480	4851280	tear through the rest of this he says a nation is expressed in the state as a living ethical entity
4851280	4858480	only in so far as it is active inactivity is death therefore the state is not only authority
4858480	4865040	which governs and confers legal form and spiritual value on individual wills but it is also power
4865040	4869760	which makes its will felt and respected beyond its own frontiers thus affording practical
4869760	4874240	proof of the universal character of the decisions necessary to ensure its development
4874240	4880560	this implies organization and expansion potential if not actual thus the state equates itself to
4880560	4885680	the will of man whose development cannot be checked by obstacles in which by achieving
4885680	4892160	self-expression demonstrates its infinity this is religious language the state is the idol of
4892160	4899600	fascism and so the last footnote is titled dynamic reality of fascism and it says there's a quote from
4899600	4906480	1926 in a speech to the senate and mussolini said i believe that if a people wish to live they
4906480	4911920	should develop a will to power otherwise they vegetate live miserably and become prey to a
4911920	4918800	stronger people in whom this will to power is developed to a higher degree well i don't know
4918800	4925120	about all that it seems like life might be spiritually conceived of better than as a will
4925120	4932320	to power which is very niche and um and not so good so the next section back the rest of this
4932320	4937360	is all doctrine now no more footnotes fascist state as a spiritual force the fascist state is
4937360	4941920	a higher and more powerful expression of personality is a force but a spiritual one
4941920	4947440	the fascist state is a spiritual force it sums up all the manifestations of the moral intellectual
4947440	4952720	life of man if function its functions therefore cannot be limited to those of enforcing order
4952720	4958320	and keeping the peace as the liberal doctrine had it is no mere mechanical device for defining
4958320	4964800	the sphere within which the individual may duly exercise his supposed rights rights his supposed
4964800	4970080	rights the individual may duly exercise his supposed rights the fascist state is an inwardly
4970080	4976320	accepted standard of rule and conduct a discipline of the whole person it permeates the will no less
4976320	4981040	than the intellect it stands for a principle which becomes the central motive of man as a
4981040	4987680	member of civilized society sinking deep down into his personality it dwells in the heart of
4987680	4993200	the man of action and of the thinker and of the artist and of the man of science it is the soul of
4993840	5000000	the soul whoa hold on also there's another freaking footnote here i apologize for being
5000000	5006640	wrong about that this is heavy duty though this is so similar to the stuff that mao says like that
5006640	5010960	we're gonna have to in in his program you have tons of freedom but it's freedom with discipline
5011440	5014880	you have to adopt the discipline yourself which is socialist discipline there here it's fascist
5014880	5020000	discipline there you have to be committed to the the building of the social state here you have to
5020000	5024320	be committed to the building of the fascist state it's literally identical so what you see again is
5024320	5030640	that fascism is a religion and it is meant that the person is supposed to and take this idol of
5030640	5038720	the state as god as god the father and live his life with no other gods before him and to venerate
5038800	5044640	this thing and make it a intrinsic part of his character and to accept the discipline of this
5045280	5052560	austere hating easy life state and work hard in order to glorify the idol that is here and in fact
5052560	5059760	it becomes not just your soul but the soul of your soul and so the footnote here um from has
5059760	5066240	two quotes one from 26 and one in in pisa and one in 29 in milan it says it it is fascism which has
5066240	5071840	refashioned the character of the italians removing impurity from our souls tempering us to all
5071840	5078160	sacrifices restoring the true aspect of strength and beauty to our italian face it is not out of
5078160	5082800	place to illustrate the intrinsic character and profound significance of the fascist levy
5082800	5087840	it is not merely a ceremony but a very important stage in the system of education and integral
5087840	5093760	preparation of italian men which the fascist revolution considers one of the fundamental
5093760	5099040	duties of the state fundamental indeed for if the state does not fulfill this duty or in any
5099040	5104640	way accepts to place it under discussion the state merely and simply forfeits its right to exist
5105520	5109040	so that means it's uh got a liturgy as well
5111600	5117280	fascism in short this is back in the doctrine document is not only a lawgiver and foundation
5117280	5124960	of founder of institutions so an idolatrous god but an educator and promoter of spiritual life
5124960	5131760	it aims at refashioning not only the forms of life but their content man his character and his faith
5131760	5136960	to achieve this purpose it enforces discipline and uses authority entering into the soul and
5136960	5143360	ruling with undisputed sway therefore it has chosen its emblem as the lictors rods the symbol
5143360	5150560	of unity strength and justice i don't know what to tell you this fascism is the state as god the
5150560	5158000	father as as an idol and nobody pushing it as a spiritual reawakening has the slightest amount
5158000	5164720	of ground to stand on they are pushing idolatry of the worst nastiest kind the next section is
5164720	5169440	titled political and social doctrine evolution from socialism so when i said earlier that in
5169440	5174720	fact we would see that fascism is the same in kind different in degree that it is the antithesis
5174720	5182080	that arises out of the thesis of socialism of marxism here's what i'm talking about they are
5182080	5186960	explaining in this section which i don't know that i really need to read a lot of it but i probably
5186960	5193440	will that fascism mussolini is explaining that fascism evolved out of it is the antithesis to
5193440	5200400	in the dialectical setting it is the it is the antithesis to marxism into socialism it says when
5200400	5207040	now when in the now distant march of 1919 speaking through the columns of the populo de italia i
5207040	5212000	summoned to milan the surviving interventionists who had intervened and who had followed me ever
5212000	5217600	since the foundation of the fasci of revolutionary action in january of 1915 i had in mind no
5217600	5222640	specific doctrinal program the only doctrine of which i had practical experience was that of
5222640	5231200	socialism from until the winter of 1914 nearly a decade my experience was that of both follower and
5231200	5236720	leader but it was not doctrinal experience my doctrine during that period had been the doctrine
5236720	5243600	of action a uniform universally accepted doctrine of socialism had not existed since 1905 when the
5243600	5249280	revisionist movement headed by bernstein arose in germany countered by the formation in the seesaw
5249280	5254560	of tendencies of a left revolutionary movement which in italy never quitted the field of phrases
5254560	5258800	whereas in the case of russian socialism it became the prelude to bolshevism
5261120	5267040	reformism revolutionism centrism the very echo of that terminology is dead while in the great river
5267040	5273520	of fascism one can trace currents which had their source in sorrel pegui legardel of the movement
5273520	5279440	socialists and in the cohort of italian syndicalists who form who from 1904 to 1914
5279440	5283920	brought a new note into the italian socialist environment previously emasculated and chlora
5283920	5290560	formed by fornicating with gelati's party a note sounded in olivetti's paginae liberae
5291120	5302160	orano's lupa and rico leone's uh diver deven devenere's social socials when the war ended in 1919
5302160	5307440	socialism of the doctrine was already dead it continued to exist only as a grudge especially
5307440	5313760	in italy where its only chance lay in inciting to reprisals against the men who had willed the war
5313760	5321680	and who were to be made to pay for it the papalo d'italia described itself in its subtitle as the
5321680	5327600	daily organ of fighters and producers the word producer was already the expression of a mental
5327600	5333760	trend fascism was not the nursling of a doctrine previously drafted at a desk it was born of the
5333760	5340320	need of action and was action it was not a party but in the first two years an anti-party and a
5340320	5347280	movement the name i gave the organization fixed its character yet if anyone dares to cares i
5347280	5351440	should say to reread the now crumpled sheets of those days giving an account of the meeting at
5351440	5357200	which the italian fasci de combatamento were founded he will find not a doctrine but a series
5357200	5362240	of pointers forecasts hints which when freed from the inevitable matrix of contingencies
5362240	5366720	were to develop in a few years time to into a series of doctrinal positions
5366720	5372080	entitling fascism to rank as a political doctrine different from all others past or present
5373280	5378560	quoting himself he says if the bourgeoisie i then said believe that they have found in us their
5378560	5384160	lightning conductors they are mistaken we must go toward the people we wish the working classes to
5384160	5388400	accustom themselves to the responsibilities of management so that they may realize that there is
5388400	5394080	no that it is no easy matter to run a business we will fight both technical and spiritual
5394080	5399040	re-regardism now that the succession of the regime is open we must not be faint-hearted
5399040	5405040	we must rush forward if the present regime is to be superseded we must take its place the right of
5405680	5410400	succession is ours for we urge the country to enter the war and we led it to victory
5410400	5414720	this the existing forms of political representation cannot satisfy us we want
5414720	5422160	direct duress direct i i guessed direst i don't know it's typo we want we'll say direct
5422160	5427440	representation of several interests it may be objected that this program implies a return to
5427440	5434560	the guild's corpora zioni uh corpora zioni uh no matter i therefore hope this assembly will accept
5434560	5440320	the economic claims advanced by national syndicalism is it not strange from the very
5440320	5447360	first day at piazza san uh sepulcro the word guild corpora zioni was pronounced a word which
5447360	5452160	as the revolution developed was to express one of the basic legislative and social creations
5452160	5458400	of the regime the years preceding the march on rome cover a period during which the need of action
5458400	5464000	forbade delay and careful doctrinal elaborations fighting was going on in the towns and villages
5464560	5468080	there were discussions but there was something more sacred and more important
5468720	5477600	death fascists knew how to die state is an idol death cult a doctrine fully elaborated divided
5477600	5483040	up into chapters and paragraphs with annotations may have been lacking but it was replaced by
5483040	5489200	something far more decisive by a faith all the time if with the help of the books articles
5489200	5493680	resolutions passed at congress's major and minor speeches anyone should care to revive the memory
5493680	5498720	of those days he will find provided he knows how to seek and select that the doctrinal foundations
5498720	5504240	were laid while the battle was still raging indeed it was during those years that fascist thought
5504240	5509440	armed refined itself and proceeded ahead with its organization the problems of the individual
5509440	5514320	and the state the problems of authority and liberty political social and more especially
5514320	5520640	national problems were discussed the conflict with liberal democratic socialistic masonic doctrines
5520640	5526880	and those with the partito populare were carried on at the same time as the punitive expeditions
5528080	5534960	partito populare sorry i don't do italian either nevertheless the lack of a formal system was used
5534960	5540080	by disingenuous adversaries as an argument for proclaiming fascism incapable of elaborating a
5540080	5546240	doctrine at the very time when that doctrine was being formulated no matter how tumultuously first
5546240	5552000	as is the case with all new ideas in the guise of violent dogmatic negations then in the more
5552000	5558400	positive guise of constructive theories subsequently incorporated in 1926 27 and 28 in the laws and
5558400	5565040	institutions of the regime fascism is now clearly defined not only as regime but as a doctrine
5565040	5570400	that means that fascism exercising its critical faculties on itself and others has studied from
5570400	5575200	its own special standpoint and judged by its own standards all the problems affecting the material
5575200	5580560	and intellectual interests now causing such grave anxiety to the nations of the world and is ready
5580560	5586160	to deal with them by its own policies so i just read that very quickly without much commentary
5586160	5591120	specifically because what you see is that it evolved out of socialism it is the antithesis
5591120	5596560	to socialism in the dialectical sense which means that the end goal is to fuse them to see that
5596560	5601840	fascism and communism or fascism and socialism are actually two sides of the same coin and we
5601840	5606880	need to understand it as one coin in other words mix the parts of them together that work to create
5606880	5612560	a comprehensive totalitarian system which is what we're dealing with today both from left and now
5612560	5621760	also from right rejection of pacifism as a pillar of fascism first of all as regards the future
5621760	5627520	development of mankind and quite apart from all present political considerations fascism does not
5627520	5632800	generally speaking believe in the possibility or utility of perpetual peace it therefore
5632800	5640080	discards pacifism as a cloak for cowardly supine renunciation and contradistinction to self-sacrifice
5640800	5647280	war alone keys up all human energies to their maximum tension and sets the seal of nobility
5647280	5653280	on these on those peoples who have the courage to face it all other tests are substitutes which
5653280	5658080	never place a man face to face with himself before the alternative of life or death
5658080	5665600	so fascism is based off of the concept of dying for your idol in the state therefore all doctrines
5665600	5671280	which postulate peace at all costs are incompatible with fascism equally foreign to the spirit of
5671280	5676400	fascism even if accepted as useful in meeting special political situations are all
5676400	5681520	internationalistic or league superstructures which as history shows crumble to the ground whenever
5681520	5686720	the heart of nations is deeply stirred by sentimental idealistic or practical considerations
5687280	5694080	fascism carries this anti-pacifistic attitude into the life of the individual i don't care a damn
5694080	5700000	the proud motto of the fighting squads scrawled by a wounded man on his bandages is not only an
5700000	5705680	act of philosophic stoicism it sums up a doctrine which is not merely political it is evidence of a
5705680	5712400	fighting spirit which accepts all risks it signifies new style of italian life the fascist
5712400	5718160	accepts and loves life he rejects and despises suicide is cowardly life as he understand it
5718160	5725360	means duty elevation conquest life must be lofty and full it must be lived for oneself but above
5725360	5732240	all for others both nearby and far off present and future so it's it's still collectivist
5732800	5737840	it's just that the state becomes god the father to rule forever instead of self-sacrificial
5738720	5746960	to to to wither away at the peak of its power the population policy of the regime is the consequence
5746960	5751840	of these premises the fascist loves his neighbor but the word neighbor does not stand for some
5751840	5757280	vague and unceasable conception love of one's neighbor does not exclude necessary educational
5758240	5762320	severity in other words you can severely educate your neighbor to be a fascist
5762880	5767520	still less does it exclude differentiation and rank so it'll be very hierarchical who's on top
5767520	5773200	and who's not fascism will have nothing to do with universal embraces as a member of the community of
5773200	5779520	nations it looks other people's straight in the eyes it is vigilant and on guard it follows others
5779520	5784000	in their manifestations and notes any changes in their interests and it does not allow itself to
5784000	5792160	be deceived by mutable and fallacious appearances pillar rejection of marxism so as i was saying
5792160	5796880	same in kind different degree it is the antithesis such a conception of life makes
5796880	5802960	fascism the resolute negation of the doctrine underlying so-called scientific marxian marxian
5802960	5808080	socialism the doctrine of historic materialism which would explain history of the history of
5808080	5812720	mankind in terms of the class struggle and by changes in the processes and instruments of
5812720	5820080	production to the exclusion of all else so this by the way is why marxists consider everything
5820080	5825280	they don't like that's opposed to them fascism because their kissing cousin which is fascism
5825280	5830000	that evolved out of them as reaction is into antithetical reaction within the dialectical
5830000	5838240	movement of history actually openly rejects them so as the open rejection of marxism is a pillar
5838240	5844640	of fascism anything that rejects marxism must also be fascism and thus you see their stupid
5844640	5851840	anti-fascist stand that the vicissitudes of economic life discoveries of raw materials new
5851840	5856880	technical processes and scientific inventions have their importance no one denies but that they
5856880	5863040	suffice to explain human history to the exclusion of other factors is absurd fascism believes now
5863040	5869280	and always in sanctity and heroism that is to say in acts in which no economic motive remote
5869280	5876560	or immediate is at work having denied historic materialism which sees men as seasoned men mere
5876560	5881600	puppets on the surface of history appearing and disappearing on the crest of the waves while in
5881600	5886880	the depths the real directing forces move and work fascism also denies the immutable and irreparable
5886880	5891520	character of the class struggle which is the natural outcome of this economic conception of
5891520	5896480	history see so fascists don't conceive economic history as the movement of economic forces
5896480	5902160	colliding with one another it sees the movement of history as the ability for man to unify in duty
5902160	5910160	around a state conception a state idol above all it denies that the class struggle is a preponderating
5910160	5916480	agent in social transformations no it sees the state the unification within the state as the
5916480	5922240	the the social transform uh transformation element having thus struck a blow at socialism
5922240	5926720	and the two main points of his doctrine all that remains of it is the sentimental aspiration as
5926720	5931760	old as humanity itself towards social relations in which the sufferings and sorrows of the humbler
5931760	5937920	folk will be alleviated but here again fascism rejects the economic interpretation of felicity
5937920	5942560	as something to be secured socialistically almost automatically at a given stage of economic
5942560	5949840	evolution when all will be assured of a maximum of material comfort fascism denies the materialistic
5949840	5954640	conception of happiness as a possibility and abandons it to the economists of the mid 18th
5954640	5960640	century this means that fascism denies the equation well-being equals happiness which sees
5960640	5966080	in men mere animals content when they can feed and fatten thus reducing them to a vegetative
5966080	5974240	existence pure and simple rejection of parliamentary democracy as a sham and a fraud
5975520	5981200	after socialism fascism trains its guns on the whole block of democratic ideologies and rejects
5981200	5985920	both their premises and their practical applications and implements fascism denies
5985920	5990480	that numbers as such can be the determining factor in human society so it's not really
5990480	5994560	on that whole consent to the governed thing unless it forces the governed to consent to
5994560	6000640	the fascist government oh it manufactures a consent and it's idle it denies the right of
6000640	6004800	numbers to govern by means of periodic consultations so we don't need elections
6005360	6012080	it asserts the irredeemable infertile and beneficent inequality of men who cannot be
6012080	6018240	leveled by any such mechanical and extrinsic device as universal suffrage so it embraces
6018240	6024000	inequality and oppression as i've argued repeatedly democratic regimes may be
6024720	6029920	may be described as those under which the people are from time to time deluded into the belief that
6029920	6035760	they exercise sovereignty while all the time real sovereignty resides in and is exercised by
6035760	6040800	other and sometimes irresponsible and secret forces all that can be true but that doesn't
6040800	6046160	mean we need to throw away all of our power and our freedom and give it to irresponsible
6046160	6052240	and secret forces in the form of a fascist state democracy is a kingless regime infested by many
6052240	6058160	kings who are sometimes more exclusive tyrannical and destructive than one even if he be a tyrant
6058160	6063280	this explains why fascism although for contingent reasons it was republican in tendency prior to
6063280	6069360	1922 in other words it had to lie until it could take power properly abandoned that stand before
6069360	6074800	the march on rome convinced that the form of government is no longer a matter of preeminent
6074880	6080080	importance because the study of past and present monarchies and past and present republic shows
6080080	6087440	that neither monarchy nor republic can be judged uh subspecies oh god it's in latin
6087440	6092640	i turned not to say under the aspect of eternity i had to look it up that is as universally and
6092640	6099440	eternally true so let me just read it in english um because the study of past and present monarchies
6099440	6104720	and past and present republic shows that neither monarchy nor republic can be judged as universal
6104720	6110320	and eternally true but that each stands for a form of government expressing the political
6110320	6115840	evolution the history the traditions and the psychology of the given country fascism has
6115840	6121440	outgrown the dilemma monarchy versus republic over which democratic regimes too long dallied
6121440	6126480	attributing all insufficiencies to the former and proving the latter as a regime of perfection
6127360	6132240	whereas experience teaches that some republics are inherently reactionary and absolutist while
6132320	6139600	some monarchies accept the most daring political and social experiments in one of his philosophic
6139600	6146480	meditations renan who had the pacifist institution a pre-fascist institution sorry remarks reason and
6146480	6151920	science are the products of mankind but it is chimerical to seek reason directly for the people
6151920	6157680	and through the people it is so elections bad it is not essential to the existence of reason that
6157680	6162160	it should be that all should be familiar with it so lots of people shouldn't be qualified to vote
6162320	6166880	and even if all had to be initiated this could not be achieved through democracy which seems
6166880	6171760	fated to lead to the extinction of all arduous forms of culture and all highest forms of learning
6171760	6175360	so only the people who understand the sense of fascism should really have the vote is what this
6175360	6180080	is saying the maxim that society exists only for the well-being and freedom of the individuals
6180080	6185280	composing it does not seem to be in conformity with nature's plans which care only for the
6185280	6190960	species and seem ready to sacrifice the individual it is much to be feared that the last word of
6190960	6195520	democracy thus understood and let me hasten to add that it is susceptible for a different
6195520	6200560	interpretation would be a form of society in which a degenerate mass would have no thought beyond
6200560	6206880	that of enjoying the ignoble pleasures of the vulgar so it doesn't think much of democracy
6207440	6213760	rejection of egalitarianism in rejecting democracy fascism rejects the absurd conventional lie of
6213760	6220720	political equalitarianism the habit of collective irresponsibility the myth of felicity and
6220720	6228640	indefinite progress definition of fascism as real democracy but if democracy be understood as
6228640	6234000	meaning a regime in which the masses are not driven back to the margin of the state and then
6234000	6239680	the writer of these pages has already defined fascism as an organized centralized authoritarian
6239680	6246880	democracy this is identical to mao's conception of uh democratic centralism which probably borrowed
6246880	6252960	from the fascists to be honest rejection of economic liberalism and admiration of bismarck
6254160	6258320	fascism is definitely and absolutely opposed to the doctrines of liberalism
6258320	6263360	both in the political and the economic sphere the importance of liberalism in the 19th century
6263360	6268000	should not be exaggerated for present-day polemical purposes nor should we make of one
6268000	6273520	of the many doctrines which flourished in that century a religion for mankind for the present
6273680	6279760	and for all time to come liberalism really flourished for 15 years only it arose in 1930
6279760	6286080	as a reaction to the holy alliance which tried to force europe to recede further back than 1789
6286080	6294480	it touched zenith in 1848 when even pious the ninth was a liberal its decline began immediately
6294480	6302320	after that year if 1848 was a year of light and poetry 1849 was a year of darkness and tragedy
6302320	6307200	the roman republic was killed by a sister republic that of france in that same year
6307200	6314160	marx and his famous communist manifesto launched the gospel of socialism in 1851 napoleon the third
6314160	6319600	made his a liberal coup d'etat and ruled france until 1870 when he was turned out by a popular
6319600	6325440	rising following one of the severest military defeats known to history the victory was bismarck
6325440	6331440	who never even knew the whereabouts of liberalism and its profits it is symptomatic that through the
6331440	6336800	19th century the religion of liberalism was completely unknown to so highly civilized people
6336800	6343040	as the germans but for one parenthesis which has been described as the ridiculous parliament of
6343040	6349280	frankfurt which lasted just one season germany attained her national unity outside of liberalism
6349280	6355120	and in opposition to liberalism that's a great thing to uphold here germany's done great a
6355120	6359680	doctrine which seems foreign to the german temperament essentially monarchical whereas
6359680	6365040	liberalism is the historical and logical anti-room to anarchy you hear that from the
6365840	6371200	the new right today all the time but it's nonsense the three stages in the making of the german unity
6371200	6378560	were the three wars of 1864 1866 and 1870 led by such liberals as moltke and bismarck and in the
6378560	6383440	upbuilding of the italian unity liberalism played a very minor part when compared to the contribution
6383440	6389680	made by mazzini and garibaldi who were not liberals but for the intervention of the illiberal
6389680	6395200	napoleon the third we should not have had lombardi and without that of the illiberal bismarck at
6395200	6402400	sadawa and at sadan we probably would not we would should not have had venetia in 1866 and in 1870 we
6402400	6409040	would not have entered rome the years going from 1870 to 1915 cover a period which marked even in
6409040	6413840	the opinion of the high priests of the new creed the twilight of their religion attacked by
6413840	6420240	decadentism in literature and by activism in practice activism that is to say nationalism
6420240	6427200	futurism and fascism the liberal century after piling up innumerable gordian knots tried to cut
6427200	6433120	them with the sword of the world war never has any religion claimed so cruel a sacrifice where the
6433120	6438240	gods of liberalism thirsting for blood you hear these same kinds of arguments by the way from this
6438240	6443440	new right today now liberalism is preparing to close the doors of its temples deserted by the
6443440	6449280	peoples who feel that the agnosticism it professed in the sphere of economics and the indifferentism
6449280	6453920	of which it has given proof in the spheres of politics and morals would lead the world to ruin
6453920	6459280	in the future as they have done in the past this explains why all the political experiments of our
6459280	6464480	day are anti-liberal and now we can look back 100 years later and see how those worked out which is
6464480	6469760	really bad and it is supremely ridiculous to endeavor on this account to put them outside of
6469760	6476240	the pale of history as though history were a perverse set a preserve set aside for liberalism
6476240	6481520	and its adepts as though liberalism were the last word in civilization beyond which no one can go
6481520	6486240	well you tried to go past that with your fascist totalitarianism and it turned out to go really
6486240	6492720	badly so the next section is called the fascist totalitarian vision of the future the fascist
6492720	6497600	negation of socialism democracy liberalism should not however be interpreted as implying a desire
6497600	6504560	to drive the world backwards to positions occupied prior to 1789 french revolution a year commonly
6504560	6510240	referred to as that which opened the demo liberal century history does not travel backwards the
6510240	6516720	fascist doctrine has not taken to master as its profit monarchical absolution absolutism is of
6516720	6524000	the past and so is ecclesiology dead and done for our feudal privileges and the division of society
6524000	6529760	into closed uncommunicating castes neither has the fascist conception of authority anything in common
6529760	6538640	with that of a police-ridden state except in practice a party governing a nation totalitarianly
6538640	6543440	is a new departure in history see you don't need police state when you just make everybody believe
6543440	6549680	the right thing all the time there are no points of reference nor of comparison from beneath the
6549680	6554560	ruins of liberal socialist and democratic doctrines fascism extracts those elements which are still
6554560	6560640	vital it preserves what may be described as the acquired facts of history and rejects all else
6560640	6566000	that is to say it rejects the idea of a doctrine suited to all times and to all people so it's
6566000	6570240	going to just be a totalitarian state that does whatever it has to do to maintain power okay got
6570240	6575920	you granted that the 19th century was the century of socialism liberalism democracy this does not
6575920	6580800	mean that the 20th century must also be the century of socialism liberalism and democracy
6580800	6586960	political doctrines pass nations remain we are free to believe that this is the century of authority
6588240	6592960	a century tending to the right a fascist century now i actually disagree when he says
6592960	6596640	here political doctrines pass the nations remain he says that nations are a people
6596640	6600480	but i think that nations are actually constituted in their constitutions and so if you completely
6600480	6605680	reorganize the political constitution of a country you actually have a new country you don't have the
6605680	6609120	same nation you have a different nation it can call itself italy before and after but it's still
6609120	6615920	a different nation and it's not just the people that's a that's a folkish way of thinking that's
6615920	6622560	being resurrected today as it was being then if the 19th century was a century of the individual
6622560	6627200	because liberalism implies individualism we're free to believe that this is the collective
6627200	6633280	century and therefore the century of the state well there you have it folks state as an idol
6634480	6639840	it is quite logical for a new doctrine to make use of the still vital elements of other doctrines
6639840	6646000	no doctrine was ever born quite new and bright and unheard of no doctor can boast absolute
6646000	6650960	originality it is always connected it only historically with those which preceded it and
6650960	6656080	those which will follow it in other words fascism arose out of socialism it is the dialectical
6656080	6662880	antithesis which will lead to a synthesis of the two thus the scientific socialism of marx links
6662880	6668240	up to the utopian socialism of the foyer's owens the saint simones thus the liberalism of the 19th
6668240	6673200	century traces its origins back to the illuministic movement of the 18th that's straight projection
6673200	6678480	it's the other way and the doctrines of democracy to those of the encyclopedist so he's blending the
6678560	6682080	he's because he keeps saying 1789 what he's doing is he's taking the french
6683440	6690720	revolution as emblematic of liberalism which that is incorrect in fact he is the communism followed
6690720	6695920	from from the french revolution and fascism followed from communism liberalism has stood
6695920	6702880	opposed to both all along so it's actually he's completely wrong on this in the same way that we
6702880	6707600	see the the new right being wrong on these things today i wonder where they got their ideas well
6707600	6710720	they are they're reading the fascist philosophers that's where they got their stupid ideas
6712080	6716560	all doctrines aim at directing the activities of men he says toward a given objective
6716560	6721760	but these activities in their turn react on the doctrine modifying and adjusting it to new needs
6721760	6728080	or outstripping it a doctrine must therefore be a vital act and not a verbal display hence the
6728080	6733680	pragmatic strain in fascism its will to power its will to live its attitude toward violence
6733680	6741040	and its value next section is the absolute primacy of the state the keystone of the
6741040	6746240	fascist doctrine is its conception of the state of its essence its functions and its aims for
6746240	6753040	fascism the state is absolute individuals and groups relative individually so it's god it's
6753040	6758880	the idol individuals and groups are admissible insofar as they come within the state instead
6758880	6763520	of directing the game and guiding the material and moral progress of the community the liberal
6763520	6769760	state restricts activities its activities to recording results the fascist state is wide awake
6769760	6776080	and has a will of its own for this reason it can be described as ethical at the first quint
6777600	6783520	quinquennial sorry assembly of the regime in 1929 i said the fascist state is not a night watchman
6783520	6788960	solicitous only of the personal safety of the citizens nor is it organized exclusively for
6788960	6792960	the purpose of guaranteeing a certain degree of material prosperity and relatively peaceful
6792960	6798400	conditions of life a board of directors would do as much neither is it exclusively political
6798400	6803280	divorced from practical realities and holding itself aloof from the multifarious activities
6803280	6808720	of the citizens and the nation the state as conceived and realized by fascism is a spiritual
6808720	6815280	and ethical entity for securing the political juridical and economic organization of the nation
6815280	6822000	an organization which in its origin and growth is a manifestation of the spirit the state
6822000	6826960	guarantees the internal and external safety of the country but it also safeguards and transmits
6826960	6833600	the spirit of the people elaborated down the ages and its language its customs its faith the state
6833600	6839280	is not only the present it is also the past and above all the future transcending the individual's
6839280	6844480	brief spell of life the state stands for the imminent conscious conscience of the nation
6844480	6850080	the forms in which it finds expression change but the need for it remains the state educates
6850080	6856400	the citizens the civics makes them aware of their mission urges them to unity its justice
6856400	6861760	harmonizes their divergent interests it transmits to future generations the conquests of the mind
6861760	6868800	and the fields of science art law human solidarity it leads men from the primitive tribal life to
6868800	6876240	that highest manifestation of human power which is imperial rule the state is an idol in fascism
6876800	6881200	the state hands down to future generations the memory of those who laid down their lives to
6881200	6887200	ensure its safety or to obey its laws it sets up as examples and records for the future ages
6887200	6891840	the names of the captains who enlarged its territory and of the men of genius who made it
6891840	6897680	famous whatever respect for the state declines in the disintegrating and centrifugal tendencies
6897680	6902880	of individuals and groups prevail nations are headed for decay that's the end of his long quote
6902880	6910080	there since 1929 economic and political development have everywhere emphasized these truths
6910080	6914960	the importance of the state is rapidly growing the so-called crisis can only be settled by
6914960	6921120	state action within the orbit of the state where are the shades of the jewels simons who in the
6921120	6926160	early days of liberalism proclaimed that the state should endeavor to render itself useless and
6926160	6931280	prepare to hand in its resignation of the mcculloughs who in the second half of this of the
6931280	6935920	last century urged that the state should desist from governing too much and what of the english
6935920	6941520	bentham who considered that all industry asked of government was to be left alone and of the german
6941520	6946400	humbolt who expressed the opinion that the best government was a lazy one what would they say now
6946400	6952080	to the unceasing inevitable and urgently requested interventions of government and business it is
6952080	6956480	true that if the second generation of economists was less uncompromising this respect than the
6956480	6961520	first and even that adam smith left the door jar however cautiously for government intervention
6961520	6967520	in business because if liberalism spells individualism fascism spells government and so
6967520	6972720	that's your statement of fascism right there if liberalism spells individualism fascism spells
6972720	6979280	government and what he's saying there just to summarize is that it was bs to ever think that
6979280	6983440	the government wouldn't be involved in business public-private partnership or the the corporate
6983440	6990560	subsidiarity state is exactly how things really work economically and work best he says the
6990560	6996320	fascist state is however a unique and original creation it is not reactionary yes it is but
6996320	7001680	revolutionary oh because it's a continuation of communism in another direction for it anticipates
7001680	7006000	the solution of certain universal problems which have been raised elsewhere in the political field
7006000	7011600	by the splitting up of parties the usurpation of power by parliaments the irresponsibility of
7011600	7016160	assemblies in the economic field by the increasingly numerous and important functions
7016160	7022240	discharged by trade unions and trade associations with the disputes and intents affecting both
7022240	7027760	capital and labor in the ethical field by the need for felt the need felt for order discipline
7027760	7034720	and obedience to the moral dictates of patriotism fascism desires the state to be strong and organic
7034720	7041200	based on broad foundations of popular support fascist state lays claim to rule in the economic
7041200	7045840	field no less than in others it makes its actions felt throughout the length and breadth of the
7045840	7051360	country by means of its corporative social and educational institutions and all the political
7051360	7056400	economic and spiritual forces of the nation organized in their respective associations
7057200	7062720	circulate within the state a state based on millions of individuals who recognize its
7062720	7067680	authority feel its action and are ready to serve its ends is not the tyrannical state of a medieval
7067680	7074400	lordling has nothing in common with the despotic states existing prior to or subsequent to 1789 no
7074400	7080160	no it's totally different it's not despotic it's totalitarian that means everybody's entire life
7080160	7086000	entire being has to be transformed and supporting the idol that's what it means just like with
7086000	7091760	communism it is same and kind different in degree says far from crushing the individual you know
7091760	7096080	here's more communist bullshit but it's fascist this time the fascist state multiplies his
7096080	7102240	energies just as in the regiment of a soldier just as in a regiment a soldier is not diminished but
7102240	7106640	multiplied by the number of his fellow soldiers the fascist state organizes the nation but it
7106640	7112720	leaves the individual adequate elbow room sounds just like mao it has curtailed useless or harmful
7112720	7119040	liberties oh it is curtailed useful useless or harmful liberties while preserving those which
7119040	7124000	are essential in such matters the individual cannot be the judge but the state only so the
7124000	7128480	state's going to decide what it is that you can and cannot do which of your liberties are useless
7128480	7133840	and harmful in which are essential we just learned all about essential workers well here you have
7133840	7138240	essential uh liberties that you're allowed to do and the rest are useless or harmful and the state
7138240	7143440	will not permit them you as an individual have no right to choose anything to do with your own life
7143440	7148000	and its liberties the state will choose them for you and extend them to you as privileges so do not
7148000	7152960	let these people in the new right convince you that this is some higher expression of freedom
7152960	7157600	that's the same lie that's been told by fascists and the same lie that's been told by communists for
7158400	7164640	a hundred years the fascist state he tells us is not indifferent to religious phenomena in general
7164640	7169920	nor does it maintain an attitude of indifference to roman catholicism the special positive religion
7169920	7175200	of italians the state has not got a theology but it has a moral code oh it doesn't have a theology
7175200	7179920	does it that's because it is its own theology he says the fascist state sees in religion one of the
7179920	7184640	deepest spiritual manifestations and for this reason it is not it not only respects religion
7184640	7190960	but defends and protects it some religions anyway the fascist state does not attempt as it rubs pierre
7190960	7194720	at the height of the revolutionary delirium of the convention to set up a god of its own
7195360	7199280	nor does it vainly seek as does bolshevism to efface god from the soul of man
7199920	7206320	fascism respects the god of aesthetics st saints and heroes and it also respects god as conceived
7206320	7212320	by the ingenuous and primitive heart of the people the god to whom their prayers are raised
7212320	7218240	in other words it doesn't actually have a religious doctrine but it's going to make sure
7218240	7223360	that you adhere to a religious doctrine and whichever one is fine it doesn't really care
7223360	7229040	it's not really bringing god back into the picture the state is actually god but there's you're going
7229040	7234160	to have to believe in some kind of a higher power god that the state is a reflection of
7235040	7240240	the fascist state expresses the will to exercise power and to command it here the roman tradition
7240240	7245840	is embodied in a conception of strength imperial power is understood by the fascist doctrine is
7245840	7251840	not only territorial or military or commercial it is also spiritual and ethical an imperial
7251840	7257440	nation that is to say a nation which directly or indirectly as a leader of others can exist without
7257440	7263360	the need of conquering a single square mile of territory fascism sees in the imperialistic spirit
7263360	7269280	that is in the tendency of nations to expand a manifestation of their vitality in the opposite
7269280	7274160	tendency which would limit their interest to the home country it sees a symptom of decadence
7274160	7280880	peoples who rise or re-arise are imperialistic renunciation is characteristic of dying peoples
7280880	7286400	the fascist doctrine is that best suited to the tendencies and feelings of a people which like the
7286400	7291280	italian after lying fallow during centuries of foreign servitude are now reasserting itself
7291280	7298160	in the world but imperialism implies discipline the coordination of efforts a deep sense of duty
7298160	7305120	and a spirit of self-sacrifice so the state becomes the deity this explains many aspects
7305120	7311280	of the practical activity of the regime and the direction taken by many of the forces of the state
7311280	7316160	as also the severity which has to be exercised toward those who would oppose the spontaneous
7316160	7321440	and inevitable movement of the 20th century italy by agitating outgrown ideologies of the 19th
7321440	7326160	century ideologies rejected wherever great experiments in political and social
7326160	7330960	transformations are being dared we see where those ended up by the way in major ditches
7331760	7337840	never before he says have the people thirsted for authority direction order as they do now so those
7337840	7343120	are warning signs that that fascism is coming is that how you feel today is that what the new
7343120	7348400	right is tapping into sounds like it if each age has its doctrine then innumerable symptoms
7348400	7355360	indicate that the doctrine of our age is the fascist that it is vital excuse me that it is
7355360	7361040	vital is shown by the fact that it has aroused a faith that this faith has conquered souls is shown
7361040	7367440	by the fact that fascism can point to its fallen heroes and its martyrs fascism has now acquired
7367520	7372400	throughout the world that universal that universally i guess universality which belongs
7372400	7379520	to all doctrines which by achieving self-expression represent a moment in the history of human thought
7379520	7384400	and so there's your expression of fascism that's what fascism is in the words of mussolini that is
7384400	7390560	the doctrine of fascism we hear this arising from the so-called new right the dissident right that's
7390560	7396160	not a good development we also see that it is actually the antithetical continuation of
7396160	7402560	communism it is thesis antithesis synthesis is the main goal and so what you actually see here
7402560	7409680	is a system of taking the state no longer as a self-sacrificing entity that liberates man from
7409680	7417120	his own imprisonment but rather that it becomes a idol that through the worship of and fealty to
7417200	7423440	the state becomes the guarantor of of man's supremacy this is this is a shift from
7425520	7430240	as sick and upside down as it is to say communism holding up the state as a christ figure
7430240	7435280	and it's a switch to the state being held up as a god figure as an emanating holy spirit that
7435280	7440800	will transform man into a functionary of the state as to an integral piece of the state and he's
7440800	7445520	considered a non-entity without that the state gives him not just his soul but the soul of his
7445520	7451760	soul and so this is idolatry of the grossest form i think it's very important that we reject
7451760	7457600	this that we do not allow this to derail the movement against woke or the fight back against
7457600	7463920	woke or whatever it is that we don't allow us to derail the upcoming election it being 2024 now
7463920	7470240	and the election coming we don't we we know that the that the left broadly speaking will use this
7470240	7475440	either as a means of directly seizing power if it has the capacity to do that to throw away liberty
7475840	7482560	or if it cannot as a means to drive the resistance to the sustainable and inclusion woke movement
7482560	7486160	that all that resistance is going to get driven into a ditch by promoting things that
7486160	7491520	scare normal people into believing that it is an existential crisis for them to fight against
7491520	7498640	conservatives this is why this is happening isn't it really good question i have severely severely
7498640	7504000	cynical suspicions as to why people like franco are being pushed why fascism is being pushed
7504000	7508560	why we're seeing all this uh rise of this kind of chest beating while we're seeing all this
7508560	7515360	new misogyny this manliness characterized here in fascism by mussolini something bad is happening
7515360	7522720	and um there's an explicit and deliberate push from agents of provocation or whatever on the
7522720	7528640	internet toward fascism and we should be taking this very seriously and not losing track the
7528640	7532880	answer lies in the constitution the answer lies in liberty the answer lies actually in the other
7532880	7539840	1789 which was the the year of the constitution the answer lies in um putting human liberty first
7539840	7546480	securing individual rights avoiding collectivism avoiding corporatism denying the idea of a
7546480	7552080	corporate subsidiarity model that is going to be able to produce but removes all human freedom and
7552080	7556960	makes us happy in the sense you know we'll own nothing and be happy in the sense that we are a
7556960	7562960	part of the movement of history toward some kind of totalitarian end the thesis gives rise to the
7562960	7568320	antithesis communism gives rise to fascism but in the end they're to be seen as the same in kind but
7568320	7573680	different in degree two parts of the same coin and synthesized and fused into one model which is
7573680	7577360	exactly what we see happening in the world which is why you see communism being pushed through
7577360	7583360	corporations worldwide in china and here in the west through the un and the world economic forum
7583360	7591760	in the world health organization
7613360	7614740	you
