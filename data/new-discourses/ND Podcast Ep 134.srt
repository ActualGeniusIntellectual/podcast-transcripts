00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,280
Hey everybody, and welcome to another episode of the New Discourses podcast.

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,340
This is James Lindsay.

3
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,800
We got to talk about fascism.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,280
We spend a lot of time talking about communism, obviously I've dedicated most of my project

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,060
to that, but we should talk a little bit about fascism too, and I want to actually, what

6
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,240
I'm going to do in this episode is I'm going to actually read to you from Mussolini.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:50,160
I'm going to read to you The Doctrine of Fascism by Benito Mussolini, which he articulated.

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,600
It's written as an article, I assume he wrote it down, but maybe he spoke it.

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,120
It also borrows from a lot of quotes that are given as footnotes that I'll present to

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,960
you as well for context, but this is from 1932, and I don't think you're going to find

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,120
a more clear articulation of the principles of fascism.

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,000
So let's put the dates on this.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We're looking at this being in 1932.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,440
The fascists have had a fair amount of power in Italy for a while.

15
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,800
We can know that, for example, just from our understanding of communist history because

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,360
the fascists were the ones who locked up Antonio Gramsci, and they locked up Antonio Gramsci,

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,740
obviously the father of cultural Marxism, in 1926.

18
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,720
And so at this point, the fascists have had power for a little while, and Mussolini is

19
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,280
now writing down the principles of, or the doctrine of fascism itself.

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,120
What I'm reading to you is an article that's on the web that is a complete translation

21
00:01:52,120 --> 00:02:00,320
of the doctrine of fascism with added context in footnotes that was written together, not

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,520
just by Benito Mussolini himself, but co-written with another guy, Giovanni Gentile, and it

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,680
says, their note about it is, it is considered to be the most complete articulation of Mussolini's

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,360
political views.

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,800
This is the only complete official translation we know of on the web, copied directly from

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,400
an official fascist government publication of 1935, which was titled Fascism Doctrine

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,200
and Institutions, published under the name of Benito Mussolini, and all the original

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,240
footnotes it says are included.

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,500
So I guess those footnotes were not added by this website, but are actually original.

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,600
Now I want to frame this before we talk about it because I don't want to just say, oh, here's

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
some fascism.

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,580
That's what we're doing here.

33
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,580
Why on earth?

34
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,420
In fact, I've been wanting to make this podcast for like a month and I'm like, I don't know

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,580
why I want, like, I want to present this.

36
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,580
I want people to see this, but I don't know why.

37
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,620
I don't know the explanation and I've been thinking about it really hard for a long time

38
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,300
and I finally have kind of come across what it is and you would think that maybe what

39
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:11,120
I want to talk about is this obvious rise on the weird kind of cool kids right or whatever

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,360
we want to call these guys, the new right, the dissident right, the alt right, the reactionary

41
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
right.

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,400
I don't know what to call these people, but it's infiltrated, of course, heavily into

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,680
what we might consider movement conservatism.

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,440
It's kind of like the conservative ink, like hard edge angle plus the groipers, which is

45
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,600
that's the whole Nick Fuentes thing.

46
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:41,020
That whole angle is just rife with this bend toward fascism, not in like, hey, that kind

47
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,940
of looks like fascism, but explicitly.

48
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,680
And whether they're real accounts or whether they're bots or whether they're something

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,580
else on social media, if you bring up anything related to this, there are all these apparently

50
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,300
super pro right wing accounts all over Twitter, at least that are like, yeah, fascism is the

51
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,620
only way.

52
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,620
But now we're starting to see influencers in the conservative space saying like Franco

53
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,420
was great, fascism is necessary.

54
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,700
And I think one of the ones I saw last night that really disturbed me was this general

55
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,940
idea that, well, maybe I don't really want fascism, but if it comes down to a binary

56
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,900
choice between fascism and communism, I'm going to choose fascism.

57
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,380
And so we've got to understand what fascism is.

58
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,540
And I'm going to read Mussolini so you understand what fascism is in that regard.

59
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,700
But we've got to take a step back because this is all part of dialectical leftism.

60
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,440
Fascism is the right hand of the left that has to be understood.

61
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,260
Now why would I say that?

62
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,740
Well let's back up to Hegel.

63
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,920
Actually let's back up even to Kant and talk about this dialectical way of thinking.

64
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,120
The dialectic per Kant is that you have the thesis and then there's the antithesis and

65
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,160
somehow you mix them together to get a synthesis.

66
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,100
But that's an extremely incorrect understanding.

67
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,680
Of course Hegel had it differently.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,720
He never said it in terms of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,760
He said it in terms of there's the abstract and then you meet its negation and then you

70
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,560
arrive at the concrete through the synthetic dialectical process.

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,640
But what is actually articulated is not that there is the thesis and its antithesis floating

72
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,520
around out there.

73
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:38,040
It is in fact that the antithesis or the negation arises from within the thing.

74
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Do you get that?

75
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,800
That's absolutely crucial to understand.

76
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:52,280
The antithesis is actually opposed to the thesis but it arises from within the thesis.

77
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,160
It's not floating around out there as the opposite that you're going to find like black

78
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
versus white.

79
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,220
It actually arises from within the thesis.

80
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,280
So when you have an abstract conception for Hegel and this is all Hegelian dialectical

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:19,200
manipulation, fascism is a dialectical phenomenon and when you have with Hegel this abstract

82
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,640
notion that you're thinking oh well here's communism or here's whatever it happens to

83
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,640
be and we're going to take the next step but we're going to dig into it and deeper and

84
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,480
deeper and deeper do that we're going to understand it at its deepest level and as we deeper

85
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,720
deeper deeper and dig into it where what do we find oh the opposite its opposite its negation

86
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,960
is hidden within it.

87
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,320
That thing that challenges it that turns it backwards in upon itself is hidden within

88
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,520
it and then the goal is to realize and to put it in the language of the principle of

89
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,040
polarity from the original hermetic doctrines that inspired all of us in the first place.

90
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,160
The goal is to realize that the antithesis is the same in kind but different in degree

91
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,560
and fascism I think we're going to hear very clearly from Mussolini is the antithesis of

92
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,000
Marxism is the antithesis of communism but that doesn't mean that it's the opposite or

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,520
the actual the enemy of communism at all.

94
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,740
It is the same in kind but different in degree in other words it's the same thing presenting

95
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:30,060
in an oppositional way and that's what when we hear fascism you're going to hear one of

96
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,180
the principles Mussolini puts forth in fact is explicitly a rejection of Marxism and so

97
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:46,220
from within Marxism arises this antithesis this opposite this negation so within communism

98
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,180
arises fascism fascism is same in kind it's still a totalitarian doctrine we're going

99
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,820
to hear that too it's different in degree it's still a state worshiping doctrine but

100
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,580
it isn't worshiping the state the same way in fact I've argued in the past that communism

101
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,820
if you want to put it kind of in the Christian trinity which you actually should communism

102
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,340
actually sees the state in the position of the sun in the position of Christ it is a

103
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,200
self-sacrificial entity that will liberate man by killing itself in the end that's actually

104
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,600
the belief in communism is that socialism will rise to a zenith of power at which point

105
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,760
it will become unnecessary and wither away the state will sacrifice itself to liberate

106
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:34,520
all people after it transforms them into purely socialist man which is to say really returns

107
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,480
them to their true human nature because that's the belief at the heart of Marxism is that

108
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,100
the true human nature is a social creative being and that we've forgotten that because

109
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:50,060
we've been imposed upon by the bourgeois elements of society within both in theory

110
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:57,380
and in practice within that however because it's a dialectical concept is its negation

111
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:03,380
and its negation is fascism fascism arises from the fear and desperation that is caused

112
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:10,300
by communism communism I think pretty clearly is caused by some combination of laziness

113
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:18,340
sloth and envy and resentment it's very clearly that and you kind of codify that into a social

114
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,260
gnostic religion and you get this Marxist communism well it turns out when you provoke

115
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,820
people when you do the praxis of communism it freaks people out people think they're

116
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,820
going to lose their society and if they don't stand up right they will and what do you do

117
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,120
well you have to stand up and you wait and you put it off and you delay and things get

118
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,580
really desperate and you get really scared and that fear and desperation that arises

119
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,180
causes people to want to band together or bind together like a bundle of sticks fascio

120
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:51,260
in Italian and adopt a fascist attitude a new totalitarian attitude to fight back against

121
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,580
communists but in fact what you're actually doing is adopting totalitarianism anyway it's

122
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,380
the same in kind but different in degree and what happens in the end the point of the dialectic

123
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:06,180
isn't that there's just this thesis and antithesis this thing and it's negation it's in fact

124
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,380
that the thing in his negation the negation arises from within the thing itself and then

125
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,580
they are placed intrinsically into conflict and through that conflict the contradictions

126
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:23,060
are worked out so that a synthetic hole that sees both sides of those things in the same

127
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:30,660
light can arise that's the idea so the goal is actually that if fascism is the dialectical

128
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,580
antithesis to communism is that the two are not there to fight one another they're there

129
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,800
to merge together into one totalitarian system that actually controls everything and that's

130
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,300
exactly what we see in the latter half of the 20th century which is a story nobody seems

131
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,340
to know if you look at the success well if you look at the Soviet system or you look

132
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,460
at the even Mao's Chinese system the CCP system they didn't work they were complete catastrophes

133
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,740
now you could say that they've been very successful at subverting and infiltrating

134
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,420
and the Cold War never ended you can say all those things quite intelligently but what's

135
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,020
really kept the socialist movement alive especially in China is the fact that Deng Xiaoping came

136
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:18,300
along as Mao's successor in the late 1970s and adopted a model with a contained market

137
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,260
they claimed that they were opening up a market but Deng Xiaoping said it was always said

138
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,540
it was for socialism it was for the glory of socialism they were just trying to get

139
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,500
China back on its productive feet because Mao absolutely destroyed it with his own cult

140
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,820
and the CCP opened a market but it's really a Potemkin market it's not a real market it's

141
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:44,300
a phony market that is at the pleasure and at the behest of the CCP if you buck the CCP

142
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,300
your standing in the market goes away but as long as you play ball it looks like you

143
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,080
get to run your company you get to own your company you get to make a ton of money you

144
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,000
end up with crazy rich Asians blah blah blah everybody there is trying to make money turns

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,560
out that that system is not a market that system is fascism that's exactly what fascism

146
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,680
did even in Italy even in Germany in the early part of the 20th century 50 years earlier

147
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,400
what it did was it allowed people to look like they were still owning their own corporations

148
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,360
but the corporations actually operated as functionaries of the state so people were

149
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,760
able to make money production was very high the fascist model unlike the communist model

150
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,680
is actually very successful at production what it's not successful at is freedom what

151
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,120
it's not successful at is liberty but of course being dialectical they claim that they have

152
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,020
a higher understanding of what liberty and freedom actually mean and they have the only

153
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,360
true freedom we'll hear that from Mussolini we know that the communists believe that we

154
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,600
know that the fascists also well we will know the fascists also believe that but more importantly

155
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,480
what you see is a synthetic model that was developed in China that's now being copied

156
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,360
here in the West whether through ESG or natural asset companies or the public-private partnership

157
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,720
or the stakeholder capitalism or whatever terms we use for their new sustainability

158
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,280
agenda that is the same model that's happening in the CCP and what it is is that you're using

159
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:12,800
corporate subsidiarity to the state power there's actually one corporation that's corporation

160
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,800
is the state and then under that you have subsidiary shell corporations that operate

161
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,120
underneath the auspices of what the state wants and allows and its doctrine that's fascism

162
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,780
and they get to make crazy money so long as they prove high levels of duty and loyalty

163
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,720
everybody else gets screwed by the way the average person is not doing better than they

164
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,360
would under freedom and what happens is the goal is well you're going to need some kind

165
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,360
of a socialistic distribution model and to make sure that the regular people who don't

166
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,080
own the big huge corporations that are the subsidiaries of the state corporation have

167
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,360
have their amount or share and you're going to have basically something that works just

168
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,640
like a communist social credit system to make sure that their distribution is determined

169
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,080
correctly whether it's a distribution of labor that they have to do that they don't want

170
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,120
to do or a distribution of goods and services or universal basic income or social credit

171
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,740
or whatever it is that allows them to make way and so what you have to understand are

172
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,080
two big pieces and then we're going to talk about we're going to read Mussolini and the

173
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:22,880
two big pieces are first number one that fascism is the antithesis or the negation of communism

174
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,660
but understood in a dialectical process what that means is that fascism is actually the

175
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:33,080
bastard son of communism it is an offspring of communism it is not something that people

176
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:39,700
want except if they want to gain totalitarian power and the communist attempt isn't working

177
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,480
it is a reaction to communism as well but that's because it's the negation that arises

178
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,640
from within it and that the goal of a dialectical pair of opposites there is a same in kind

179
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:58,760
but different in degree or different in form same in kind same totalitarian system same

180
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,800
statist religion same catastrophe for the average person but on the other hand it's

181
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,400
different in degree so that the two can be synthesized and the project whether we look

182
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,160
at it in terms of Deng Xiaoping whether we look at it in terms of what Herbert Marcuse

183
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,440
was writing in one-dimensional manth in the 1960s and also in the essay on liberation

184
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,520
in the 1960s and encounter revolution and revolt in the early 1970s when we read Marcuse

185
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,720
we see very clearly that he has this issue and I've talked about this I've done podcasts

186
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,800
on this I've written essays about this I eventually should probably write a book but I already

187
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,080
wrote the essay so I don't know what to do explaining that the model was that capitalism

188
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,440
has the ability to produce but it's not sustainable so you need a sustainable capitalism paired

189
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,440
alongside dialectically paired alongside socialism which has the right ideology but it can't

190
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,960
produce so we need a productive socialism and a sustainable capitalism that become increasingly

191
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,800
close to the same model well those models are going to have to be distributist in nature

192
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,700
and distributism becomes the overarching brand that does it and what we have then is these

193
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,360
Potemkin markets like in China and like they're building under stakeholder capitalism that

194
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,640
are fascism but the reaction that we're having here just like throughout all of history is

195
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,720
a reaction to create same in kind but different in degree a fascist reaction and what happens

196
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,800
in practice like take for example the Franco did Franco save Spain well it's run by socialists

197
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,760
right now so at least in the longer run of history the answer is no no he did not in

198
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,440
fact what happens is these fascist systems don't tend to work they are very high at productivity

199
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,960
they tend to be very for a while they tend to repel communism but they're utterly totalitarian

200
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,540
people become dissatisfied people get deposed people get murdered people the whole totalitarian

201
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,800
nightmare is still happening and the whole thing becomes unstable it's held together

202
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,800
typically by a military dictator who when he dies or his family dynasty falls apart

203
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,580
the whole thing falls apart and you end up handing a century of moral authority to the

204
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:07,020
left plus an apparatus that's already stopped defending human rights or individual rights

205
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,580
I shouldn't say human rights human rights is some bullshit that's out of the United

206
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:15,800
Nations the individual rights individual rights end up on that sacrificed on the altar to

207
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,840
build the fascist state and when then when the fascist state falls apart because it's

208
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,400
actually a totalitarian nightmare and it's usually held together again by a military

209
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,760
style dictator when that falls apart and it inevitably does you hand that apparatus plus

210
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,400
a century's worth of unassailable moral authority to the other side so that you just made the

211
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,720
job so much easier for the socialists who are going to come in and say well the excesses

212
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,520
of the right were awfully terrible and awfully bad and awfully scary so we're going to do

213
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,020
this correctly now we're going to do this in the name not of oppression but of the oppressed

214
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,040
and it's not hard to get massive public sentiment behind it and you see that in South America

215
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,800
again and again you see that in Spain you see that in Greece you see that in lots of

216
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,440
places that have tried to experiment with this strongman bullshit that always backfires

217
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,980
in the end and it makes you wonder why this is getting pushed on the so-called dissident

218
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,440
right or new right or whatever right idiot right fucking idiot right right now as we

219
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:21,000
go into a obviously highly important and contentious election year besides the fact

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
that obviously what it's going to do is give argument to all of the insane claims of the

221
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,580
left making those things come true reifying the left's boogeyman so that it scares your

222
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:38,340
average middle you know middling voter your average low information democrat voter who's

223
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,980
getting real scared that stuff's not working economically that they're doing weird stuff

224
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,720
with the kids that the schools are out of control and failing they're becoming cognizant

225
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,720
that the left thing's failing whatever is going on with this whole israel-palestine

226
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,160
they're getting cognizant that something's not right well better get them back scared

227
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,280
as shit of the republicans and of the conservatives by coming out hard with fascism and a bunch

228
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,800
of misogyny and hating women and badgering women for existing and whatever else and trying

229
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,060
to say that you want to repeal the 19th and take away their vote and like the whole thing

230
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,640
is designed to lose but at any rate let's pretend it's not let's pretend it's not a

231
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:23,660
pitfall it's designed to lose let's hear in mussolini's own words what fascism is so we

232
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:31,000
begin like all this is mussolini writing in the 1930s on the doctrine of fascism like

233
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,560
all sound political conceptions fascism is action and it is thought okay so it's theory

234
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,560
and praxis just like communism because it's the same in kind but different in degree got

235
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,400
you fascism is action and it is thought action in which doctrine is imminent that's exactly

236
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,360
what the point of communism is i could go read to you 30 sources like in a flash i could

237
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:01,400
pull up the definition of truth where uh on marxists.org where um they say that the there's

238
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,860
different definitions of truth there's the empirical definition where we check evidence

239
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,860
there's a rational where it has to be logically consistent there's the pragmatist where it's

240
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,540
what works is considered true and he says that the communist version of the marxist

241
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,220
version of truth is closest to the pragmatist it's what works but it has to also be in line

242
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:25,780
with theory in other words it is action praxis in which doctrine is imminent so here we are

243
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,980
we're not even through the first sentence and it's obvious that fascism is the same

244
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,220
formulation of communism that is same in kind different in degree in other words another

245
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,420
way to phrase that would be two branches same tree like all sound political conceptions

246
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:48,780
fascism is action and it is thought action in which doctrine is imminent and doctrine

247
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,640
arising from a given system of historical forces in which it is inserted and working

248
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:04,920
on them from within ps guys that's exactly the same idea in communism that is exactly

249
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,640
the same idea there's these historical forces where a part of them those historical forces

250
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:16,080
determine the necessary framework of our doctrine for a utilitarian uh application in order

251
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,600
to gain power in order to be able to do our action and our action is going to be reflective

252
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,640
against the doctrine and our doctrine is going to be reflective against the the the

253
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,880
action in its results in the world because it's a scientific conception a mechanistic

254
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,720
conception of how politics should work mussolini there then says it therefore has a form correlated

255
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,800
to contingencies of time and space yet again we're seeing same in kind different in degree

256
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,800
the marxists in particular the postmodernists that came right after this were very much

257
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,940
so interested in saying that everything's contingent to time and space but marx himself

258
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,560
was very interested in pointing out that politics is completely contingent to time and space

259
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,960
this isn't about universal ideals so don't let the people pushing this fascist shit on

260
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,920
the right tell you it's about universal morals and principles it therefore has a form correlated

261
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,900
to contingencies of time and space in other words that the means justify the ends the

262
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,940
ends being that these people get to have power and repel their enemies the means justify

263
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:25,440
the ends says but it also has an ideal content it's idealist just like communism communism

264
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,680
is the it's like the the the the i'm picturing like a cell doing a cell division like from

265
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:40,340
biology slides or whatever it's like or or like saturn disgorging like having a birth

266
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,600
out of its own side or whatever from myth from mythology it's communism is giving birth

267
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,320
to this bastard child called fascism it's the same thing same in kind but different

268
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,300
in degree mussolini says it also has an ideal content which makes it an expression of truth

269
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:05,440
in the higher region of the history of thought that's exactly the same thing that we hear

270
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,320
from the communists okay i'm not saying that fascism communism were the same by the way

271
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,480
they're not they're not fascism is actually the degenerate child of communism as degenerate

272
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,980
as communism is pretending to be virtuous it's wearing the false mantle of virtue in

273
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,260
the sense of being like almost an anti-christ but here we have a footnote actually there

274
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,480
are a couple but i've skipped some and this is mussolini message for the year first of

275
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:43,080
october message for the year one october 27 1930 that he gave in milan he said today

276
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:49,780
i hold that fascism as an idea a doctrine a realization is universal it is italian in

277
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:55,420
its particular institutions but it is universal in the spirit nor could it be otherwise yet

278
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,360
again you see the child of the communist thinking they have the one universal science of how

279
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,520
all humans relations actually work it is universal to everybody but it arises in particulars

280
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,680
and the particulars are held in opposition to the universal and we see how the how the

281
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,000
particulars are actually just a part of a greater whole blah blah blah it's the same

282
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,520
model and of course it's also like mystically inevitable because it is universal in the

283
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,960
spirit nor could it be otherwise the spirit is universal by reason of its nature therefore

284
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,140
anyone may foresee a fascist europe drawing inspiration for her institutions from the

285
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,080
doctrine and practice of fascism europe in other words giving a fascist turned solution

286
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,200
of problems which beset the modern state the 20th century state which is very different

287
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,600
from the states existing before 1789 by the way i did some legwork to make sure because

288
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,560
two things happened in 1789 we have the american constitution but we also have the beginning

289
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,560
of the french revolution he's talking about the french revolution french revolution is

290
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:08,160
in the dialectical space as well turns out that that's the model of esoteric tyranny

291
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:17,080
that has plagued mankind since 1789 and really before posing as though it's some kind of

292
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,680
liberal advancement in in society which it is not it says and the states formed immediately

293
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:28,360
after the french revolution today fascism fills universal requirements fascism solves

294
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,240
the threefold problem of relations between state and individual between state and associations

295
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:42,840
between associations and organized associations so that's that's a footnote remark there about

296
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:49,600
what fascism is and to put the point on the fact that it has ideal content which makes

297
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,760
it an expression of truth in the higher region of the history of thought as mussolini had

298
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,040
it continuing with mussolini's doctrine there is no way of exercising a spiritual influence

299
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,280
in the world as a human will dominating the will of others unless one has a conception

300
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:10,360
of both the transient and the specific reality on which that action is to be exercised and

301
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,280
of the permanent and universal reality in which the transient dwells and has its being

302
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:24,700
so yet again we're seeing this idealism permeating the entire story but the point now is exercising

303
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,740
a spiritual influence on them in the world as a human will dominating the will of others

304
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:39,200
so what the the whole point is literally a will to power for fascism it's throwing off

305
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,280
the pretenses of liberation so what you have is with communism that's obviously it's got

306
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,960
a pretense to liberation but it obviously wants to remind people who they really are as socialists

307
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,700
fascism is like no no no no we're not going to do that we're not no more pretenses of liberation

308
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,680
what we're actually going to do is we're going to dominate the will of others because we understand

309
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,240
better it's very clearly saying that exercising spiritual influence in the world is a human will

310
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,880
dominating the will of others and to do that you have to have a conception both of the transient

311
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,440
and the specific reality on which the action is to be exercised and of the permanent and universal

312
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,760
reality in which the transient dwells and has its being which they of course believe they know and

313
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,520
nobody else knows so that's why they have to have this complete dominating authoritarian power in

314
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:29,000
fact totalitarian power as we'll hear to know men Mussolini tells us one must know man and to know

315
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,920
man one must be acquainted with reality and its laws so of course they know these better than

316
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,760
everybody this is what you hear from our stupid right right now as well there can be no conception

317
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,560
of the state which is not fundamentally a conception of life philosophy or intuition

318
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:51,200
system of ideas evolving within the framework of logic or concentrated in a vision or a faith but

319
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,720
always at least potentially an organic conception of the world he then goes on to explain that in

320
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,360
fact fascism is based on a spiritual view of life it is a religion and the god of that religion is

321
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,880
the state I mentioned earlier I never finished the thought because here we are it's me how are

322
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:20,720
you doing happy new year that that where communism sees the state as in the position of Christ in the

323
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,720
Christian Trinity what I think we're gonna hear is that fascism sees the position of the state in

324
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,160
the position of God the Father so it's not the self-sacrificial son the fascist state has no

325
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,800
intention whatsoever of sacrificing itself it is going to rule eternally and it holds itself up

326
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:44,000
more in the position of the father than the son and so it is a perversion an inversion of the

327
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,400
holiness of God posing as you know supreme holiness obviously and so it's a spiritual view of life

328
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,360
here's what what Mussolini has to say about it thus many of the practical expressions of fascism

329
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,520
such as party organization system of education and discipline can only be understood when

330
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,680
considered in relation to its general attitude toward life which is a spiritual attitude and in

331
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:16,520
a footnote which quotes a number of different speeches that he gave in 1930 and 1926 looks

332
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:24,600
like in 1929 all of which seemed to have taken place in Milan I'll read these three quotes the

333
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,480
political process is flanked by a philosophic process if it be true that matter was on the

334
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,600
altars for one century today it is the spirit which takes its place all manifestations peculiar

335
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,360
to the democratic spirit are consequently repudiated easygoing this improvisation the

336
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,320
lack of a personal sense of responsibility the exaltation of numbers and of that mysterious

337
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,800
divinity called the people all creations of the spirit starting with that religious I'm assuming

338
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:59,240
with the religious are coming to the fore and nobody dare keep up the attitude of anti-clerical

339
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,680
ism which for several decades was a favorite with democracy in the Western world by saying

340
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:10,120
that God is returning we mean that spiritual values are returning okay so what's he talking

341
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,880
about well we can guess that he's talking about kind of the Weimar situation that everything is

342
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,680
getting very decadent this was in 1930 through the 1920s the liberal democracy experiment was

343
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,440
failed it turned into this decadence it turned into this mess and you have people in this kind

344
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,520
of having this quasi mysterious divinity of the people that has a democratic will and what that

345
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,520
has led to is a deletion of spiritual values listen to how similar this sounds to the stuff

346
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,080
we're facing today and so now it's time for God to return through the fascists of course by saying

347
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,520
that God is returning we mean that spiritual values are returning so with this footnote what

348
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,400
we're seeing is the color that the fascist view of life as a spiritual attitude is in fact one

349
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,880
where spiritual values God is returning spiritual values are returning so that sounds like it might

350
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,760
be okay except what we're also going to discover is that for the fascists state the state itself

351
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:10,840
is God not not some transcendent deity that it nods to in order to cover itself it's again it's

352
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:17,560
an inversion of genuine religion and in 1927 there's another quote in this footnote it's

353
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,400
multiple quotes in one footnote he says there's a field reserved more to meditation upon the

354
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:28,880
supreme ends of life than to a research upon these ends consequently science starts from experience

355
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,040
but breaks out fatally into philosophy and in my opinion philosophy alone can enlighten science and

356
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,200
lead to the universal idea so we're here again talking about what is the universal idea this is

357
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,320
the Gnostic conception that these platonic thinkers can somehow figure out what the true

358
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,440
universal idea is and then use not just science but science has to transform into philosophy but

359
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,440
no no no no no no no that's not right philosophy alone can enlighten science and lead to the

360
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,720
universal idea in other words just like with communism they have the idea that they actually

361
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,680
understand the true nature of reality and that science has to bend to their true understanding

362
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:10,320
of reality it gets the whole relationship upside down in exactly the same way as Plato in fact

363
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,700
what you see with fascism is an attempt to recover the the Platonic Republic from the

364
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:23,480
Marxist inversion of the Platonic Republic Marxists want to create the Platonic Republic upside down

365
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,680
with them in charge and the hoi polloi elevates the top to fall to the bottom and be ruled over

366
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,160
the fascists are just just doing away with the pretense and they're saying now it's all that's

367
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,520
you can't turn the the pyramid of society upside down it's just going to collapse and so that's not

368
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,160
going to work and so what we're going to do is we're going to recover the platonic view and so

369
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,480
we as the philosopher kings can alone enlighten science in other words tell the science what the

370
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,440
right answers to the science are kind of like with kovat or with their spiritual values or

371
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,680
whatever in order for us to approach the universal idea which they believe that they have an inkling

372
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,880
of that nobody else gets to have so they get to rule with an iron fist in a totalitarian state

373
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,480
speaking in 29 Mussolini added in order to understand the fascist movement one must first

374
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,720
appreciate the underlying spiritual phenomenon in all its vastness and depth see they are the true

375
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,040
spiritualists here the manifestations of the movement have been a power of a powerful and

376
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,520
decisive nature but one should go further in point of fact Italian fascism has not only been

377
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,240
a political revolt against weak and incapable governments who had allowed state authority to

378
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,200
decay and were threatening to arrest the progress of the country but also a spiritual revolt against

379
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,080
old ideas which had corrupted the sacred principles of religion of faith of country fascism therefore

380
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:50,480
has been a revolt of the people does this not a sound like what's happening today on the so-called

381
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,960
new right or dissident right but also be a lot like communism it is in fact it's a spiritual

382
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,080
revolt against old ideas that had corrupted we need new ideas the fascist ideas and those

383
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,400
fascist ideas are gonna be based off of a idol built out of religion faith and country in fact

384
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,840
that's what fascism does it holds up instead of it claims that it's that's centered on God but

385
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,560
it's centered on the state which is holds up the sacred principles of religion of faith and of

386
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,520
country but really what it does is it constructs an idol out of these things and forces people to

387
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:30,480
worship it so those that footnote aside Mussolini explains fascism sees in the world not just those

388
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,200
superficial material aspects in which man appears as an individual yet again same and kind different

389
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,360
in degree from communism man appears as an individual he's not really one standing by

390
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,920
himself self-centered subject to natural law which instinctively urges him toward a life of selfish

391
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,520
momentary pleasure oh my god that's exactly what the dissident right says all the time now classical

392
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,240
liberalism atomizes people it leads them to be self-centered subject to natural law but ignoring

393
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,720
it so he's instinctively urged towards selfish momentary pleasure what do you how many more

394
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,200
fucking times do i have to hear Jordan Peterson say he didn't stick something he doesn't he

395
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,600
shut up jesus christ it sees not only the individual but the nation and the country

396
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,200
individuals and generations bound together by a moral law with common traditions and a mission

397
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,960
which suppressing the instinct for life closed in a brief circle of pleasure builds up a higher life

398
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,520
founded on duty a life free from the limitations of time and space in which the individual by

399
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,600
self-sacrifice the renunciation of self-interest by death itself can achieve that purely spiritual

400
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:52,080
existence in which his value as a man consists so fascism is that you get to build up a higher life

401
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,400
around what death itself it's a fucking death cult i don't know how many times we have to

402
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,960
point these things out why because it's the bastard child of communism it is the same in

403
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,600
kind but different in degree of course it's another death cult but through self-sacrifice

404
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,320
and the renunciation of self-interest in other words you have to break your own will and give

405
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,680
it over to the higher will which is incorporated literally that's the word for it here by the way

406
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,800
corporate incorporated in the fascist state which is held up as a kind of idol idol or god to be

407
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,520
worshipped he says this concept is therefore a spiritual one concept of fascism arising from

408
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,360
the general reaction of the century against the materialistic positivism of the 19th century

409
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,040
so there's where we're seeing the Weimar phenomenon everything got materialistic it got

410
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,840
decadent and we're gonna get very austere now anti-positivistic but positive neither skeptical

411
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:56,160
nor agnostic hmm neither pessimistic nor supinely optimistic as are generally speaking the doctrines

412
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,920
all negative which place the center of life outside man oh it's a man-centered religion

413
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,200
whereas by the exercise of his free will man can and must create his own world just like in

414
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,240
communism man becomes his own creator the creator of his own world this is i guess if we're gonna

415
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,720
just stick with that term idolatry this is same in kind different in degree from fascism or from

416
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,840
communism so fascism is the negation or antithesis of communism which means that

417
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,000
dialectically speaking the goal is going to be to let them clash in violent collision so that

418
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,440
you can pick up the pieces and synthesize them into a greater whole which is a totalitarian

419
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:47,040
system that works see fascism can produce and it has the discipline of the people and a

420
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:55,200
distributist model however it's very unfair so you need an equity and sustainability-minded approach

421
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,120
that's brought in from the other side from the communistic side the degrowth side the you know

422
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:07,120
the equity and inclusion model this is this they're going to be synthesized so when we bend

423
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,680
when we see a fascist or sorry when we see a communist provocation and we see a fascist

424
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,800
reaction you can damn well bet that the goal is that they have the same overarching system in

425
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,160
place and those are going to eventually be mixed and so we sell out our freedom we throw away our

426
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,160
liberty in the name of trying to gain security against this provocation the communist provocation

427
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,880
and when we do what we actually do is set the stage for the bastard child of communism to

428
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,200
come into power and then mate with communism itself and create a bastard grandchild which is

429
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,680
the system that they want to install which is ultimately this distributive system where they

430
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,120
get to decide who gets what and who does what work that's what he's talking about and man must

431
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:57,040
create his own world that's at the center of the fascist idolatry fascism he says this is

432
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,720
Mussolini again fascism wants man to be active and to engage in action with all his energies

433
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,400
it wants him to be manfully aware of the difficulties besetting him and ready to face them

434
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:17,760
so in our time we see this huge destruction of masculinity and so the fascist rhetoric fits

435
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,760
right into that will it fit right into it back then too fascism conceives of life as a struggle

436
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,200
in which it behooves a man to win for himself a really worthy place first of all by fitting himself

437
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,600
physically morally and intellectually to become the implement required for winning it so we're

438
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,080
not going to fight through class identification as in communism we're going to fight through becoming

439
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:48,320
a super soldier basically and fitting into a soldier unit which actually is given later in

440
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,400
this description so just like communism but different it doesn't see the life in terms of

441
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,640
class struggle it sees life in terms of intrinsic struggle so those who can rise to the top the best

442
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,760
deserve to be on top so as i've said before where communism says oppression is the problem and we

443
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:14,000
alone can end it fascism says no no actually oppression is how we got good and we should do

444
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,840
a lot more of it as for the individual it says so for the nation this is mussolini as for the

445
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:26,720
individual so for the nation and so for mankind hence the high value of culture in all its forms

446
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,240
artistic religious scientific this is one of the reasons i'm really uncomfortable with these

447
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,760
accounts these propaganda accounts on social media posing like look at what high culture

448
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,920
could be again it's creating this vision of a romantic vision of the past that inspires this

449
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,920
fascistic mindset and the outstanding importance of education well we all know what actually the

450
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,880
fascist did with education was that they used the prussian schooling model to create um

451
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,400
little automatons uh not that much differently from what mao did and what the soviets did

452
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,320
so that's not that good hence also the essential value of work by which man subjugates nature and

453
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,840
creates the human world economic political ethical and intellectual again we see same

454
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:22,640
and kind different and degree from uh communism and we see reflections of exactly what the so

455
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,920
called new right thinks is a great idea now we really need to be thinking more carefully about

456
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,600
what we're dealing with and our responses to the circumstances that were put in through this huge

457
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:39,840
global communist provocation we're facing right now so there are a couple footnotes this one is

458
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,000
headed as the positive conception of life as struggle so fascism holds a positive conception

459
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,800
of life as struggle and here's what mussolini had to say on that topic um in 1920 um in this

460
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:00,000
case in trieste and he said struggle is at the origin of all things for life is full of contrasts

461
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,760
there is love and hatred white and black day and night good and evil and until these contrasts

462
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:12,320
achieve balance struggle faithfully remains at the root of human nature so this is ultimately the

463
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:18,480
hermetic polarity model that just like communism uses the idea is that there's these contrasts

464
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,800
there's distinctions and they are in conflict with one another struggle between them

465
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:32,160
however he says it is good for it to be so so this is where i said that fascism doesn't say

466
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,920
that these things are bad and should be transcended it says no these things are good and should be

467
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,240
elevated today we can indulge in wars economic battles conflicts of ideas but if a day came

468
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,920
to pass when struggle ceased to exist that day would be tinged with melancholy it would be a day

469
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:55,760
of ruin the day of ending but that ever discloses new horizons by attempting to restore calm peace

470
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,400
tranquility or a would-be fighting the tendencies of the sorry or a would-be fighting the tendencies

471
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,560
of the present period of dynamism or we must prepare be prepared for other struggles and for

472
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,560
other surprises peace will only come when people surrender to a christian dream of universal

473
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,920
brotherhood when they can hold out hands across the ocean and over the mountains and then that

474
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,920
sounds really great because it's nodding toward christianity and then what does mussolini say

475
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,160
personally i do not believe very much in these idealisms but i do not exclude them for i exclude

476
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,400
nothing so he doesn't really believe in it but we'll hold it up as an emblem because he's building

477
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,120
an idol in the state he goes on in his doctrine to explain this positive conception of life is

478
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,960
obviously an ethical one it invests the whole field of reality as well as the human activities

479
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:57,360
which master it no action is exempt from moral judgment no activity can be despoiled of the value

480
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,640
which a moral purpose confers on all things therefore life conceived of by the fascist

481
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,040
is serious austere and religious that's what the new right seems to think we all want to

482
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,960
have even though we also all know that they're kind of decadent behind the scenes and complete

483
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,680
jerks all its manifestations are poised in a world sustained by moral forces and subject

484
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:26,400
to spiritual responsibilities the fascist disdains an easy life so that's again

485
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:35,280
kind of this same in kind different degree from communism it's actually the picture of throwing

486
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,040
off the illusion of communism so communism has this illusion that we're all going to have a life

487
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,680
of liberated leisure fascism's like no no no we're not we're going to all work and miserable toil

488
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,240
forever and in lots of conflict and struggle there will never be harmony and if there was

489
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:55,600
we'd be sad about it now there's a footnote here that's headed fascism's ethical conception

490
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:01,920
and he says i called the organization fasci italiani de combatimento this hard metallic

491
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,400
name comprised the whole program of fascism as i dreamed it now listen to how he addresses his

492
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:16,880
people this is him in 1932 in a talk titled we're against easy life okay so i'm gonna read some of

493
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,680
that part again this is this hard metallic name fasci italiani de combatimento this hard metallic

494
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,920
name comprised the whole program of fascism as i dreamed it and then he says comrades comrades

495
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:41,920
comrades this is still our program fight life for the fascist is a continuous ceaseless fight

496
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,160
which we accept with ease with great courage with the necessary intrepidity

497
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:56,400
you touch the core of fascist philosophy he says when a recent when recently a finnish

498
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,040
philosopher asked me to expound to him the significance of fascism in one sentence i wrote

499
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:10,560
in german we are against the easy life in his doctrine he writes the fascist conception of

500
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:17,200
life is a religious one in which man is viewed in his imminent relation to a higher law

501
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,960
endowed with an objective will transcending the individual and raising him to conscious

502
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,840
membership of a spiritual society those who perceive nothing beyond opportunistic

503
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:35,680
considerations in the religious policy of the fascist regime fail to realize that fascism is

504
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,880
not only a system of government but also and above all a system of thought and the footnote

505
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,040
on the religious conception of fascism quotes again from milan mussolini saying in 1930

506
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,320
if fascism were not a creed how could it endow its followers with courage and stoicism

507
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,240
only a creed which has soared to the heights of religion can inspire such words as past the lips

508
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:09,360
now lifeless alas of frederico florio it's a religion fascism is a religion a religion of

509
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:15,520
what well it's a religion of the fascist state as it turns out based on the idea of conflict

510
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:23,040
and a positive conception of itself through constant ceaseless struggle austerity severity

511
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,240
i wonder why it doesn't work in the end wonder why people get so dissatisfied and get so upset

512
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,320
with it and then you end up handing over all the authority to the left fascism is not an

513
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,600
answer to communism it is the next stage of stalled communism on its way to the true

514
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:44,000
implementation of communism when communism stalls fascism arises when fascism arises

515
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:52,240
it sets the preconditions necessary to move into the new form of actually existing socialism and

516
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,120
we see this again and again through history it is not an answer even though it speaks

517
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,800
in an idolatrous way toward what look like important pieces of the answer for example

518
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,640
the next section of this document is titled the importance of tradition yes in fact tradition is

519
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:15,600
important yes in fact communists destroy tradition yes in fact that is a positive direction to point

520
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,480
to to pay attention to because tradition is in fact an ex a kind of codification of experiments

521
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:27,680
upon what has worked in the past which is valuable however we're going to turn it into

522
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:35,200
an idol if we're fascists what does Mussolini say in the fascist conception of history man is man

523
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,480
only by virtue of the spiritual process to which he contributes as a member of the family the

524
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,800
social group the nation and in function of history to which all nations bring their contribution

525
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,520
hence the great value of tradition and records and language and customs in the rules of social life

526
00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:03,200
outside history man is a non-entity that's what that's what he had to say that's what Mussolini

527
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,800
had to say about tradition that's it there's a footnote here where we get a quote from his

528
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,080
speech in Milan from 1930 again tradition certainly is one of the greatest spiritual

529
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,960
forces of a people in as much as it is successive and constant creation of their soul

530
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,160
so that's on the historical and realistic conception allegedly of fascism as compared

531
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:29,920
to other doctrines so i just want to kind of go back to that part though outside history

532
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,480
man is a non-entity but fascism has the same view of history roughly that communism has which is

533
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,960
that history is this kind of productive capacity of man and creating and telling his own story

534
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:50,800
and only within that are you even an entity so your role is to contribute to what to the

535
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,760
grand movement of history which is exactly what the class conflict in communism is about

536
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,840
except this is different because it's a rejection of that in in the dialectical way in communism

537
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:06,880
the classes are to awaken to a class consciousness to realize that they are historical movers and

538
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:13,440
take part in their contribution to the movement of history toward an arc of liberation in fascism

539
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:21,040
you are to awaken to your consciousness as a member of the bound together unified state and

540
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,840
make your contribution toward the bending of history toward whatever the hell the fascist

541
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,800
think lies at the end of it which is not exactly clear because it seems to be relentlessly fighting

542
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:37,440
uh it's actually imperialism i think if we get further down so the next section is titled

543
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,840
rejection of individualism and the importance of the state and i should add just uh parenthetically

544
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:51,040
that the subject headings here were added by the curators of this website not by Mussolini so he

545
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,680
didn't he just wrote the doctrine this subject heading rejection of individualism and the

546
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,400
importance of the state is the summary of this next section and what Mussolini had to say about

547
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,440
it is fascism is therefore opposed to all individualistic abstractions based on 18th

548
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,840
century century materialism it is opposed to all Jacobinistic utopias and innovations so it's

549
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:18,640
against liberalism and it's against uh communism Jacobins are the precursors really to the communist

550
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,880
so we can just say that that's roughly the same thing that's the french social contract idea

551
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,160
it does not believe in the possibility of happiness on earth as conceived by the

552
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,840
economist literature of the 18th century in other words Thomas Jefferson's idea of life

553
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:40,240
liberty and the pursuit of happiness and uh John Locke's conceptions of pursuing happiness and many

554
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:47,280
of the uh English enlightenment's views of the value of pursuing a life worth living those are

555
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,600
out in fascism it rejects that it does not believe in the possibility of happiness or even the smiles

556
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:59,760
of heaven as it was sometimes phrased on earth as conceived by the economistic literature of

557
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,400
the 19th century and it therefore rejects the theological notion that at some future time the

558
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,800
human family will secure a final settlement of all its difficulties in fascism war is forever

559
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:16,880
this notion runs over sorry this notion runs counter to experience which teaches that life

560
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,760
is in continual flux and is uh sorry is in continual flux and in process of evolution

561
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:31,040
in politics fascism aims at realism in practice it desires to deal only with those problems

562
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:37,520
which are the spontaneous product of historic conditions and which find or suggest their own

563
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:44,400
solutions so i urge you once again to realize that fascism is not a solution to communism it is the

564
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:52,480
same thing same in kind different in degree they are two branches of the same tree the footnote

565
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:59,120
here reads uh here quoting several uh different uh pieces from it looks like another speech he

566
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:05,600
gave in Milan in 1930 our temperament leads us to appraise the concrete aspect of problems rather

567
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:11,600
than their ideological or mystical sublimation therefore we easily regain our balance our battle

568
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:18,000
is an ungrateful one yet it is a beautiful battle since it compels us to count only upon our own

569
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,040
forces revealed truths have torn to sorry revealed truths we have torn to shreds so much for your

570
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:31,920
religion i guess dogmas we have spat upon we have rejected all theories of paradise we have baffled

571
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,240
charlatans white red black charlatans who placed miraculous drugs on the market to give a happiness

572
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:46,160
to mankind we do not believe in program and plans and saints or apostles above all we believe not in

573
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:52,800
happiness in salvation or in the promised land we do not believe in a single solution be it

574
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,880
economical political or moral a linear solution of the problems of life because of illustrate

575
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:05,200
illustrious choristers from all of the sacri i don't think that this is a real word

576
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:12,400
sacristies that's got to be a mistype sorry because of the elusive choristers because of

577
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,480
illustrious choristers from all the sacristies life is not linear and never can be reduced to

578
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:26,240
a segment traced by primordial needs only by entering into the process of reality this is back

579
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,480
in the doctrine by the way one sentence and another footnote from milan only by entering

580
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,800
into the process of reality and taking possession of the forces at work within it can man act on

581
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:41,920
nature sorry can man act on man and on nature i really butchered a very important sentence

582
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,000
let me read the whole sentence again after reminding you that that's what mark said the

583
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,600
point of man's act life activity is is to work on man and nature to bring out his true nature

584
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,400
so for the communist it is that you are a socialist that is going to live in perfect

585
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,560
harmony in your perfectly creative environment for the fascist is that you are going to be

586
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:08,480
a socialist who works in perfect harmony with the state apparatus that actually makes socialism work

587
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:16,960
oh but he says only by entering into the process of reality just like communism and taking

588
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,720
possession of the forces at work within it we don't call that seizing the means of production

589
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,800
here i guess can man act on man and on nature that's exactly the same program as communism with

590
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,040
different ends same in kind different in degree it's a dialectical antithesis

591
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:36,240
of communism and therefore it is meant to synthesize or blend with communism into one

592
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:42,480
coherent system on the other side of the reaction after a tremendous conflict we should not be

593
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,800
supporting this and we should not be supporting people who are supporting this the footnote here

594
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,400
to that particularly interesting very communistic sentence is we are not and do not wish to be

595
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,840
motionless mummies with faces perpetually turned toward the same horizon nor do we wish to shut

596
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,400
ourselves up within the narrow hedges of subversive bigotry where formulas like

597
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:08,000
prayer of a professed religion are muttered mechanically we are men living men who wish

598
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,160
to give our contribution however modest to the creation of history we uphold moral and

599
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:20,880
traditional values which socialism neglects or despises but above all fascism has a horror

600
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:27,520
of anything implying an arbitrary mortgage on the mysterious future in spite of the theories

601
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,560
of conservation and renovation of tradition and progress expounded by the right and the left

602
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:39,120
we do not cling desperately to the past as as to a last board of salvation yet we do not dash

603
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:46,320
headlong into the seductive mists of the future negation eternal immobility mean damnation

604
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:54,320
i am all for motion i am one who marches on this is fascism so in his doctrine he goes on

605
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:59,360
again a short piece before another footnote anti-individualistic the fascist conception of

606
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:04,640
life stresses the importance of the state see it's holding up the state as a religious idol

607
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,680
it is anti-individualistic your goal is not to merge with the class as in communism it is to

608
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:19,040
merge with the state overall which is ultimately what happens at the end of communism and then the

609
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,400
state goes away and communism but the state persists so the self-sacrificial christ state

610
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:31,040
and communism is replaced by the eternally enduring god the father state in fascism

611
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:37,200
it's just another idol though anti-individualistic so you aren't you you're just part of the state

612
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,520
the fascist conception of life stresses the importance of the state and accepts the individual

613
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:47,680
only insofar as his interests coincide with those of the state which stands for the conscience and

614
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:55,360
the universal will of man as a historic entity so the state is your conscience the state is your

615
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:03,760
universal state of being that is what you must remember you are you are a part of a cog within

616
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:11,280
the fascist state and your individuality is not welcome we must not support the people

617
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:17,120
supporting fascism as though it's a solution to the problems america face faces it is to throw

618
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:24,000
america away in order to try to save america the footnote here is headed the individual and liberty

619
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:32,080
and here we have a conference in milan that's being quoted from 1929 we were the first to

620
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:38,960
state in the face of demo liberal individualism that the individual exists only insofar as he is

621
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:45,280
within the state and subjected to the requirements of the state and that as civilization assumes

622
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,240
aspects which grow more and more complicated individual freedoms becomes more and more

623
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:58,560
restricted exactly the same model he says that we're not going to reject 1789 meaning the french

624
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:03,520
revolution of course he doesn't want to reject russo's social contract program this is exactly

625
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,840
what he's articulating individual freedom becomes more and more restricted we could quote from

626
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:13,200
max horkheimer explaining that freedom and justice are dialectical concepts the more of one you have

627
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:22,400
the less of the other oh same thing here so the individual exists only insofar as he is within

628
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,800
the state so the human's true nature that the fascist understands in a gnostic way is that

629
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,680
you are a cog within the state and so you must be subjected to the requirements of that state

630
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,760
and as the civilization assumes aspects which grow more and more complicated think of how

631
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:43,440
complicated life is now individual freedom becomes more and more restricted this is exactly the shit

632
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,560
we hear from the world economic forum all the time by the way and this is what we hear from the tradd

633
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:53,280
right this new right or dissident right or whatever where they want to start restricting

634
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,280
more and more freedom because people are doing it wrong and we can't possibly have freedom because

635
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,600
freedom leads to atomization and conflict and blah blah blah and that's what really gave rise

636
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,920
to communism in the first place which is not true what we're seeing is the same in kind but

637
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:13,280
different in degree it is the reaction to communism but he goes on here in his speech 29 29 in milan

638
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,480
he says the state sorry the sense of the state grows within the consciousness of Italians for

639
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,680
they feel that the state alone is the irreplaceable safeguard of their unit and independence

640
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:31,200
that the state alone represents continuity into the future of their stock and their history sounds

641
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,480
very much like an idol it's like moses coming down from the mountain and they've got the golden

642
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:42,880
calf there but the golden calf is a state and moses calls over and says what have you done and

643
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,640
the guy's like i don't know we just took all the gold and we threw it in the fire and out came this

644
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:54,080
state that we're all a part of now it's straight idolatry now we switch to another speech in this

645
01:00:54,080 --> 01:01:01,520
part of the footnote from 1928 also in milan and we'll go back to the 1921 or 29 one in the next

646
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:07,760
part it says if in the course of the last eight years we have made such astounding progress you

647
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:14,480
may well think and suppose and foresee that in the course of the next 50 or 80 years the onward

648
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:21,360
trend of italy of this italy we feel to be so powerful so full of vital fluid yuk will be really

649
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:30,400
grandiose it will be so especially if concord lasts among citizens ps it didn't if the state

650
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:37,360
continues to be the sole arbiter arbitrator sorry in political and social conflicts if all remains

651
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:43,280
within the state and nothing outside the state if all remains within the state nothing outside the

652
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:49,440
state if all remains within god and nothing outside of god the state is an idol in fascism

653
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,800
because it is impossible to conceive any individual existing outside the state unless he be

654
01:01:54,800 --> 01:02:04,000
a savage whose home is in the solitude of the sandy desert and then coming back to 1929 a year

655
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,520
later he said fascism has restored to the state its sovereign functions by claiming its absolute

656
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:15,120
ethical meaning against the egotism of classes and categories to the government of the state

657
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:20,640
which was reduced to a mere instrument of electoral assemblies it has restored dignity

658
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:26,400
as representing the personality of the state and its power of empire it has rescued state

659
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:33,840
administration from the weight of factions and party interests so back to the doctrine the first

660
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:38,720
half of this by the way has tons of footnotes and then the second half doesn't fascism mussolini

661
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:44,720
tells us is opposed to classical liberalism let's be real clear about that sounds like today

662
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,760
fascism is opposed to classical liberalism which arose as a reaction to absolutism

663
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,720
and exhausted its historical function when the state became the expression of the conscience

664
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:02,320
and will of the people liberalism denied the state in the name of the individual fascism reasserts

665
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:08,320
the rights of the state as expressing the real is the real essence of the individual so did you get

666
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:14,480
that here's the intrinsic conflict liberalism denies the state and the name of the individual

667
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,840
that's why it's actually the answer to communism that's not what fascism says fascism reasserts the

668
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:25,520
rights of the state as expressing the real essence of the individual the individual the person you

669
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:36,000
your true human nature is a piece of the state that's fascism and in a footnote from uh may 1929

670
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:41,600
in milan he says let no one think of denying the moral character of fascism i will deny the moral

671
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:46,720
character of fascism actually you motherfucker let no one think of denying the moral character

672
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,280
of fascism for i should be ashamed to speak from this tribune if i did not feel that i represent

673
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:57,360
the moral and spiritual powers of the state what would the state be if it did not possess a spirit

674
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:02,960
of its own and a morality of its own which lend power to the laws in virtue of which the state

675
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,720
is obeyed by its citizens the fascist state claims its ethical character it is catholic

676
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:16,000
but above all it is fascist it's an idol in fact it is exclusively and essentially

677
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,720
fascist catholicism completes fascism in this we openly declare but let no one think they can turn

678
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,200
the tables on us under cover of metaphysics or philosophy so if you think this is really about

679
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,600
your religion you are dead wrong you know the state is going to replace your religion

680
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,280
all you stupid trad caths thinking this is a good idea you need to stop

681
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,880
it is catholic but above all it is fascist in fact it is exclusively and essentially fascist

682
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,640
don't let anybody think they can turn the tables on us you're not going to

683
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:53,520
under the cover of metaphysics or philosophy he says that uh fascism is a state which is fully

684
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:58,720
aware of its mission and represents a people which are marching on a state which is which

685
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:05,600
necessarily transforms the people even in their physical aspect just like communism same and kind

686
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,240
different in degree in order to be something more than a mere administrator the state must utter

687
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:17,200
great words expound great ideas and place great problems before the people and so what does he

688
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,000
think of liberty in the doctrine he says and if liberty is to be the attribute of living men and

689
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,840
not of abstract dummies invented by individualistic liberalism then fascism stands for liberty well

690
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:33,040
there's your dialectical inversion isn't it and for the only liberty worth having having what's

691
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:39,280
the only liberty worth having according to benito mussolini the liberty of the state and of the

692
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:45,760
individual within the state so the footnote here says quoting from a speech in 1924 in milan

693
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:54,080
the vol sorry the concept of freedom is not absolute uh-oh just like the communists uh-oh

694
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:59,920
uh-oh freedom is a dialectical concept because nothing is ever absolute in life freedom is not

695
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:07,920
a right it is a duty it is not a gift it is a conquest it is not equality it is a privilege

696
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,360
privilege of what granted by the state this is a complete rejection of the idea that our rights

697
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,840
come from god and so any charlatan on the right who says that our rights come from god and then

698
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:25,680
advocates for fascism is a fucking liar got that they're not lying they are a fucking liar

699
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:35,040
got it freedom is a privilege from the deified state that's fascism the concept of freedom

700
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:40,240
changes with the passing of time exactly like communism there is a freedom in times of peace

701
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,280
which is not the freedom of times of war there is a freedom in times of prosperity which is not a

702
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:52,640
freedom to be allowed in times of poverty in our state the individual is not deprived of freedom

703
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:58,320
in fact he has greater liberty than an isolated man because the state protects him and he is part

704
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:04,400
of the state isolated man is without defense so in other words you can have a little bit of security

705
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:10,000
and lose your freedom and somehow that becomes greater freedom because now you're protected

706
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:16,480
yeah same scam different day the doctrine another short paragraph before another long footnote

707
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,760
the fascist conception of the state is all embracing outside of it no human or spiritual

708
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:28,640
values can exist much less have value did you get that part the fascist conception of the state is

709
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:38,800
all embracing it's the idol outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist outside of the state

710
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:46,560
no human or spiritual values can exist much less have value thus understood fascism is totalitarian

711
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:52,400
that's Mussolini describing his own doctrine right there black and white thus understood

712
01:07:52,400 --> 01:08:00,000
fascism is totalitarian and the fascist state a synthesis and unit inclusive of all values

713
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,040
interprets develops and potentiates the whole life of a people yet again the fascists are

714
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:13,440
gnostics who figured out that the state is the true nature of man and to be part of the hive

715
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:19,920
of the state is what you have to remember you actually are the footnote says today we may tell

716
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:26,160
the world of the creation of the powerful united state of italy ranging from the alps to sicily

717
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:31,280
this state is expressed by a well-organized centralized unitarian democracy where people

718
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,760
circulate at ease indeed gentlemen if you admit the people into the citadel of the state

719
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:41,280
and the people will defend it if you close them out the people will assault it in the

720
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:46,880
fascist regime the unity of classes the political social and choral unity of the italian people is

721
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:55,840
realized within the state and only within the fascist state so the doctrine comes back to say

722
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,400
no individuals or groups political parties cultural associations economic unions social

723
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:07,760
classes exist outside of the state this is explained further in a footnote with the heading

724
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:13,600
conception of a cooperative state he says we have created the united state of italy remember that

725
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:20,240
since the empire italy had not been a united state here i wish to reaffirm solemnly our doctrine of

726
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:26,000
the state here i wish to reaffirm affirm with no weaker energy the formula i expounded at the

727
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:33,360
skala in milan everything in the state nothing against the state nothing outside the state

728
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:41,600
is god outside the state no no god is in the state god is part of the state god is

729
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:50,000
subsidiary subsidiary to the state god is out of the picture and the idol of the state is central

730
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,640
stop letting these so-called religious people tell you that they're trying to bring back religious

731
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:01,200
and spiritual values in the guise of fascism nothing could be further from true fascism he

732
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:06,160
says back in the doctrine is therefore opposed to socialism to which unity within the state which

733
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:12,560
amalgamates sorry which amalgamates classes into a single economic and ethical reality is unknown

734
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:18,320
so in other words because socialism operates off of a picture of class consciousness and antagonism

735
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:24,160
it doesn't unify the state in one single mass so it's opposed that's the reason fascism is

736
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:29,680
opposed to socialism and which sees in history nothing but class struggle that's another reason

737
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:34,560
that it's opposed to socialism because your goal isn't to be an awakened oppressed class that wants

738
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,280
to overthrow the the oppressive chains of society it's to realize that you are part of the oppressive

739
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:44,640
state itself and that your role is to uphold the power of the oppressive state it's exactly like

740
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,920
i've been explaining to people for a couple of years now fascism he says is likewise opposed to

741
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,760
trade unionism as a class weapon but when brought within the orbit of the state fascism recognizes

742
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:01,040
the real needs that gave rise to socialism and trade unionism giving them due weight in the

743
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:06,080
guild or corporative system in which divergent interests are coordinated and harmonized

744
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,960
in the unity of the state and the footnote it says we are in other words a state which controls

745
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:17,280
all forces acting in nature we control political forces we control moral forces we control economic

746
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:23,520
forces therefore we are a full-blown corporative state we stand for a new principle in the world

747
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:30,320
we stand for sheer categorical definitive antithesis to the world of democracy plutocracy

748
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:36,320
freemasonry to the world which still abides by the fundamental principles laid down in 1789

749
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,120
which is the french revolution which is not exactly the thing to be holding up as a great

750
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:46,400
program here everything is in the state the state is your idol

751
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:54,640
the ministry of corporations this is back in the actual doctrine is not a bureaucratic organ nor

752
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,120
does it wish to exercise the functions of syndical organizations which are necessarily independent

753
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:04,320
since they aim at organizing selecting and improving the members of syndicates the ministry

754
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:10,400
of corporations is an institution in virtue of which in the center and outside integral corporation

755
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,880
becomes an accomplished fact where balance is achieved between interests and forces of the

756
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:21,120
economic world this is the Deng Xiaoping model by the way this is that you have a corporative state

757
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:27,920
and then there are corporations that are actually shells of that overarching state that operates in

758
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,760
a fascistic subsidiarity way so when you have a state corporation and then the real corporations

759
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:39,040
that do the real production act in concert with the public-private partnership stakeholder

760
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:45,280
capitalism CCP Deng Xiaoping model whatever one you want to pick what you have is fascism

761
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:50,080
you have fascist subsidiarity where the corporations do the will of the state

762
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:54,640
and you say well what's happening isn't communism now because that's what we have here it's fascism

763
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,720
that's what's happening in the u.s no no they fused guys they fused they're already together

764
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:03,440
they mixed that was the project of the second half of the 20th century when you try to separate

765
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,480
fascism and communism in the world today you're thinking about terms that haven't been relevant

766
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:14,240
since like the 1920s and 1930s that's all obsolete since the 1960s 1970s communism and

767
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:20,080
fascism have fused into a single system as would happen when the thesis and the antithesis are seen

768
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:26,000
together and finally become seen as two pieces of the same puzzle two same and kind different

769
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:33,040
in degree and are synthesized into a single thing and this is what he's describing such a glance is

770
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,040
so what the problem is here let me just explain before i go on even though i'm pushing it on my

771
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:45,120
time here what they realize is the fascism can produce sort of but it can't make people happy

772
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,680
it can't actually make the people like it's not good it doesn't work it's completely unstable

773
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:54,720
so what they need is a system of distribution that actually mimics the promises of communism

774
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:01,920
and so what they did was they it's fascism for the corporate universe and it's it's uh communism for

775
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:08,400
for the people for the regular people that's the new model this program doesn't actually work it

776
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,160
works better than communism but it doesn't work so if you just mix them two together you could

777
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:16,160
have a totalitarian system that works if you want to know what it looks like in practice look at

778
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:22,000
china he says such a glance is possible only within the sphere of the state because the state

779
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,800
alone transcends the contrasting interests of groups and individuals not god don't let these

780
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,480
people fool you into thinking this is religious it's state religion it's an idol of the state

781
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:40,560
in view of coordinating them to achieve higher aims the achievement of these aims is speeded

782
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,560
up by the fact that all economic organizations acknowledged safeguarded and supported by the

783
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:51,200
corporative state exist within the orbit of fascism in other terms they accept the conception

784
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:58,560
of fascism in theory and in practice and it says we have constituted a corporative fascist state

785
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:04,480
to the state of national society a state which concentrates controls harmonizes and tempers the

786
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:11,440
interests of all social classes which are thereby protected in equal measure again safety committee

787
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:17,680
on public safety there's your 1789 thing that's the french revolution being at the center of

788
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:24,400
what's going on here whereas during the years of demo liberal regime labor looked with diffidence

789
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:29,680
upon the state was in fact outside of the state and against the state and considered the state

790
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:35,440
an enemy of every day in every hour there is not one working italian today who does not seek a

791
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:41,360
place in his corporation or federation who does not wish to be a living atom of the great immense

792
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,360
living organization which is the national corporate state of fascism imagine that life you

793
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:52,960
get to be part of the big state idol in the doctrine he writes grouped according to their

794
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,560
several interests individuals form classes these divergent interests form trade unions when

795
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:03,120
organized according to their several economic activities but first and foremost they form

796
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:11,680
the state which is no mere matter of numbers the sons of so it says sons s-u-n-s here by the way

797
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:18,160
i'm not sure if that's a typo the sons of the individuals forming the majority fascism is

798
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:23,920
therefore opposed to that form of democracy which equates a nation to the majority lowering

799
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,360
it to the level of the largest number but it is the purest form of democracy same kinds of

800
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:34,640
lies communism tells if the nation be considered as it should be from the point of view of quality

801
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:41,440
rather than quantity as an idea the mightiest because the most ethical the most coherent the

802
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:48,240
truest expressing itself in a people as the conscience and the will of the few if not indeed

803
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:54,480
of one an ending to express itself in the conscious and conscience and will of the mass

804
01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:00,720
of the whole group ethnically molded by natural and historical conditions into a nation advancing

805
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:06,400
as one conscience and one will along the same lines of development and spiritual formation

806
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:13,920
not a race which he notes as a 95% of feeling when he's talking about race not a race nor a

807
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:19,840
geographically defined region but a people historically perpetuating itself a multitude

808
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:26,400
unified by an idea and imbued with the will to live the will to power self-consciousness

809
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:35,360
and personality this is this is fascism right there so it is an ethno state held up as an idol

810
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,520
in which everyone has to understand themselves and there is nothing outside of it and it is the

811
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:47,520
basis of your of your religious existence he says in so far as it is embodied in a state this higher

812
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:52,960
personality becomes a nation it is not the nation which generates the state that is an antiquated

813
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:58,720
naturalistic concept which is which afforded a basis for 19th century publicity in favor of

814
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:04,400
national governments rather it is the state which creates the nation connected with the

815
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:11,280
nation conferring volition and therefore real life on a people made aware of their moral unity

816
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:18,560
the right to national independence does not arise from any merely literary and idealistic form of

817
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:24,240
self-consciousness still less from a more or less passive and unconscious de facto situation

818
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:29,840
but from an active self-conscious political will expressing itself in action and ready to prove

819
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:37,760
its rights it arises it arises in short from the existence at least in fieri of a state and d indeed

820
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:43,840
it is the state which has the expression of a universal ethical will creates the right to a

821
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:49,360
to national independence so the state is an expression of universal ethical will it's again

822
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:57,520
it's an idol footnote here long one on the conception of a state mussolini explains a

823
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,800
nation exists in as much as it is a people a people rise in as much as they are numerous

824
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:07,680
hard-working and well-regulated power is the outcome of this threefold principle this by the

825
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:11,680
way is the same stuff you hear from the christian nationalist people for example stephen wolf in his

826
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:17,600
book the case for christian nationalism fascism he says does not deny the state fascism maintains

827
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:24,640
that a civic society national or imperial cannot be conceived unless in the form of a state for us

828
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:30,320
the nation is mainly spirit and not only territory there are states which owned immense

829
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:35,760
territories and yet left no trace in the history of mankind neither is it a question of number

830
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,320
because there have been in history small microscopic states which left immortal

831
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:45,680
imperishable documents in art and philosophy the greatness of a nation is the compound of all of

832
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:51,600
these virtues and conditions a nation is great when the power of the spirit is translated into

833
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,240
reality so just like with the christian trinity that's been perverted and through hagel and

834
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:02,400
inverted through marks and then re-inverted in fascism you see that there's a holy spirit that is

835
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:08,480
flowing forth from the state that embodies the people with their will and their character

836
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:16,000
this is a perverse religion state as the state as an idol that's what fascism is

837
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:22,640
we wish to unify the nation within the sovereign state which is above everyone and can afford to

838
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:28,320
be against everyone since it represents the moral continuity of the nation in history

839
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:33,920
without the state there is no nation there are merely human aggregations subject to all the

840
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:40,480
disintegrations which history may inflict upon them that was him speaking in 24 by the way in

841
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:46,480
milan as well in the doctrine and then we get to the last footnote and we can finally just

842
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:51,280
tear through the rest of this he says a nation is expressed in the state as a living ethical entity

843
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:58,480
only in so far as it is active inactivity is death therefore the state is not only authority

844
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:05,040
which governs and confers legal form and spiritual value on individual wills but it is also power

845
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:09,760
which makes its will felt and respected beyond its own frontiers thus affording practical

846
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,240
proof of the universal character of the decisions necessary to ensure its development

847
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:20,560
this implies organization and expansion potential if not actual thus the state equates itself to

848
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,680
the will of man whose development cannot be checked by obstacles in which by achieving

849
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:32,160
self-expression demonstrates its infinity this is religious language the state is the idol of

850
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:39,600
fascism and so the last footnote is titled dynamic reality of fascism and it says there's a quote from

851
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:46,480
1926 in a speech to the senate and mussolini said i believe that if a people wish to live they

852
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:51,920
should develop a will to power otherwise they vegetate live miserably and become prey to a

853
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:58,800
stronger people in whom this will to power is developed to a higher degree well i don't know

854
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:05,120
about all that it seems like life might be spiritually conceived of better than as a will

855
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:12,320
to power which is very niche and um and not so good so the next section back the rest of this

856
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:17,360
is all doctrine now no more footnotes fascist state as a spiritual force the fascist state is

857
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:21,920
a higher and more powerful expression of personality is a force but a spiritual one

858
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:27,440
the fascist state is a spiritual force it sums up all the manifestations of the moral intellectual

859
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:32,720
life of man if function its functions therefore cannot be limited to those of enforcing order

860
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:38,320
and keeping the peace as the liberal doctrine had it is no mere mechanical device for defining

861
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:44,800
the sphere within which the individual may duly exercise his supposed rights rights his supposed

862
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:50,080
rights the individual may duly exercise his supposed rights the fascist state is an inwardly

863
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:56,320
accepted standard of rule and conduct a discipline of the whole person it permeates the will no less

864
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:01,040
than the intellect it stands for a principle which becomes the central motive of man as a

865
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:07,680
member of civilized society sinking deep down into his personality it dwells in the heart of

866
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:13,200
the man of action and of the thinker and of the artist and of the man of science it is the soul of

867
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:20,000
the soul whoa hold on also there's another freaking footnote here i apologize for being

868
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:26,640
wrong about that this is heavy duty though this is so similar to the stuff that mao says like that

869
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:30,960
we're gonna have to in in his program you have tons of freedom but it's freedom with discipline

870
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,880
you have to adopt the discipline yourself which is socialist discipline there here it's fascist

871
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:40,000
discipline there you have to be committed to the the building of the social state here you have to

872
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,320
be committed to the building of the fascist state it's literally identical so what you see again is

873
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:50,640
that fascism is a religion and it is meant that the person is supposed to and take this idol of

874
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:58,720
the state as god as god the father and live his life with no other gods before him and to venerate

875
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:04,640
this thing and make it a intrinsic part of his character and to accept the discipline of this

876
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:12,560
austere hating easy life state and work hard in order to glorify the idol that is here and in fact

877
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:19,760
it becomes not just your soul but the soul of your soul and so the footnote here um from has

878
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:26,240
two quotes one from 26 and one in in pisa and one in 29 in milan it says it it is fascism which has

879
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:31,840
refashioned the character of the italians removing impurity from our souls tempering us to all

880
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:38,160
sacrifices restoring the true aspect of strength and beauty to our italian face it is not out of

881
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:42,800
place to illustrate the intrinsic character and profound significance of the fascist levy

882
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:47,840
it is not merely a ceremony but a very important stage in the system of education and integral

883
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:53,760
preparation of italian men which the fascist revolution considers one of the fundamental

884
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:59,040
duties of the state fundamental indeed for if the state does not fulfill this duty or in any

885
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:04,640
way accepts to place it under discussion the state merely and simply forfeits its right to exist

886
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,040
so that means it's uh got a liturgy as well

887
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:17,280
fascism in short this is back in the doctrine document is not only a lawgiver and foundation

888
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:24,960
of founder of institutions so an idolatrous god but an educator and promoter of spiritual life

889
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:31,760
it aims at refashioning not only the forms of life but their content man his character and his faith

890
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,960
to achieve this purpose it enforces discipline and uses authority entering into the soul and

891
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:43,360
ruling with undisputed sway therefore it has chosen its emblem as the lictors rods the symbol

892
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:50,560
of unity strength and justice i don't know what to tell you this fascism is the state as god the

893
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:58,000
father as as an idol and nobody pushing it as a spiritual reawakening has the slightest amount

894
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,720
of ground to stand on they are pushing idolatry of the worst nastiest kind the next section is

895
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:09,440
titled political and social doctrine evolution from socialism so when i said earlier that in

896
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:14,720
fact we would see that fascism is the same in kind different in degree that it is the antithesis

897
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:22,080
that arises out of the thesis of socialism of marxism here's what i'm talking about they are

898
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:26,960
explaining in this section which i don't know that i really need to read a lot of it but i probably

899
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:33,440
will that fascism mussolini is explaining that fascism evolved out of it is the antithesis to

900
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:40,400
in the dialectical setting it is the it is the antithesis to marxism into socialism it says when

901
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:47,040
now when in the now distant march of 1919 speaking through the columns of the populo de italia i

902
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:52,000
summoned to milan the surviving interventionists who had intervened and who had followed me ever

903
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,600
since the foundation of the fasci of revolutionary action in january of 1915 i had in mind no

904
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:02,640
specific doctrinal program the only doctrine of which i had practical experience was that of

905
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:11,200
socialism from until the winter of 1914 nearly a decade my experience was that of both follower and

906
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:16,720
leader but it was not doctrinal experience my doctrine during that period had been the doctrine

907
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:23,600
of action a uniform universally accepted doctrine of socialism had not existed since 1905 when the

908
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:29,280
revisionist movement headed by bernstein arose in germany countered by the formation in the seesaw

909
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:34,560
of tendencies of a left revolutionary movement which in italy never quitted the field of phrases

910
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,800
whereas in the case of russian socialism it became the prelude to bolshevism

911
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:47,040
reformism revolutionism centrism the very echo of that terminology is dead while in the great river

912
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:53,520
of fascism one can trace currents which had their source in sorrel pegui legardel of the movement

913
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:59,440
socialists and in the cohort of italian syndicalists who form who from 1904 to 1914

914
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,920
brought a new note into the italian socialist environment previously emasculated and chlora

915
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:10,560
formed by fornicating with gelati's party a note sounded in olivetti's paginae liberae

916
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:22,160
orano's lupa and rico leone's uh diver deven devenere's social socials when the war ended in 1919

917
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:27,440
socialism of the doctrine was already dead it continued to exist only as a grudge especially

918
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:33,760
in italy where its only chance lay in inciting to reprisals against the men who had willed the war

919
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:41,680
and who were to be made to pay for it the papalo d'italia described itself in its subtitle as the

920
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:47,600
daily organ of fighters and producers the word producer was already the expression of a mental

921
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:53,760
trend fascism was not the nursling of a doctrine previously drafted at a desk it was born of the

922
01:28:53,760 --> 01:29:00,320
need of action and was action it was not a party but in the first two years an anti-party and a

923
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:07,280
movement the name i gave the organization fixed its character yet if anyone dares to cares i

924
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,440
should say to reread the now crumpled sheets of those days giving an account of the meeting at

925
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:17,200
which the italian fasci de combatamento were founded he will find not a doctrine but a series

926
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:22,240
of pointers forecasts hints which when freed from the inevitable matrix of contingencies

927
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:26,720
were to develop in a few years time to into a series of doctrinal positions

928
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:32,080
entitling fascism to rank as a political doctrine different from all others past or present

929
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:38,560
quoting himself he says if the bourgeoisie i then said believe that they have found in us their

930
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:44,160
lightning conductors they are mistaken we must go toward the people we wish the working classes to

931
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:48,400
accustom themselves to the responsibilities of management so that they may realize that there is

932
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:54,080
no that it is no easy matter to run a business we will fight both technical and spiritual

933
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:59,040
re-regardism now that the succession of the regime is open we must not be faint-hearted

934
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:05,040
we must rush forward if the present regime is to be superseded we must take its place the right of

935
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:10,400
succession is ours for we urge the country to enter the war and we led it to victory

936
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:14,720
this the existing forms of political representation cannot satisfy us we want

937
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:22,160
direct duress direct i i guessed direst i don't know it's typo we want we'll say direct

938
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:27,440
representation of several interests it may be objected that this program implies a return to

939
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:34,560
the guild's corpora zioni uh corpora zioni uh no matter i therefore hope this assembly will accept

940
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:40,320
the economic claims advanced by national syndicalism is it not strange from the very

941
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:47,360
first day at piazza san uh sepulcro the word guild corpora zioni was pronounced a word which

942
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:52,160
as the revolution developed was to express one of the basic legislative and social creations

943
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:58,400
of the regime the years preceding the march on rome cover a period during which the need of action

944
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:04,000
forbade delay and careful doctrinal elaborations fighting was going on in the towns and villages

945
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,080
there were discussions but there was something more sacred and more important

946
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:17,600
death fascists knew how to die state is an idol death cult a doctrine fully elaborated divided

947
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:23,040
up into chapters and paragraphs with annotations may have been lacking but it was replaced by

948
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:29,200
something far more decisive by a faith all the time if with the help of the books articles

949
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:33,680
resolutions passed at congress's major and minor speeches anyone should care to revive the memory

950
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:38,720
of those days he will find provided he knows how to seek and select that the doctrinal foundations

951
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:44,240
were laid while the battle was still raging indeed it was during those years that fascist thought

952
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:49,440
armed refined itself and proceeded ahead with its organization the problems of the individual

953
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:54,320
and the state the problems of authority and liberty political social and more especially

954
01:31:54,320 --> 01:32:00,640
national problems were discussed the conflict with liberal democratic socialistic masonic doctrines

955
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:06,880
and those with the partito populare were carried on at the same time as the punitive expeditions

956
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:14,960
partito populare sorry i don't do italian either nevertheless the lack of a formal system was used

957
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:20,080
by disingenuous adversaries as an argument for proclaiming fascism incapable of elaborating a

958
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:26,240
doctrine at the very time when that doctrine was being formulated no matter how tumultuously first

959
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:32,000
as is the case with all new ideas in the guise of violent dogmatic negations then in the more

960
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:38,400
positive guise of constructive theories subsequently incorporated in 1926 27 and 28 in the laws and

961
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:45,040
institutions of the regime fascism is now clearly defined not only as regime but as a doctrine

962
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:50,400
that means that fascism exercising its critical faculties on itself and others has studied from

963
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:55,200
its own special standpoint and judged by its own standards all the problems affecting the material

964
01:32:55,200 --> 01:33:00,560
and intellectual interests now causing such grave anxiety to the nations of the world and is ready

965
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:06,160
to deal with them by its own policies so i just read that very quickly without much commentary

966
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:11,120
specifically because what you see is that it evolved out of socialism it is the antithesis

967
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:16,560
to socialism in the dialectical sense which means that the end goal is to fuse them to see that

968
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:21,840
fascism and communism or fascism and socialism are actually two sides of the same coin and we

969
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:26,880
need to understand it as one coin in other words mix the parts of them together that work to create

970
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:32,560
a comprehensive totalitarian system which is what we're dealing with today both from left and now

971
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:41,760
also from right rejection of pacifism as a pillar of fascism first of all as regards the future

972
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:47,520
development of mankind and quite apart from all present political considerations fascism does not

973
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,800
generally speaking believe in the possibility or utility of perpetual peace it therefore

974
01:33:52,800 --> 01:34:00,080
discards pacifism as a cloak for cowardly supine renunciation and contradistinction to self-sacrifice

975
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:07,280
war alone keys up all human energies to their maximum tension and sets the seal of nobility

976
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:13,280
on these on those peoples who have the courage to face it all other tests are substitutes which

977
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:18,080
never place a man face to face with himself before the alternative of life or death

978
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:25,600
so fascism is based off of the concept of dying for your idol in the state therefore all doctrines

979
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:31,280
which postulate peace at all costs are incompatible with fascism equally foreign to the spirit of

980
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:36,400
fascism even if accepted as useful in meeting special political situations are all

981
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:41,520
internationalistic or league superstructures which as history shows crumble to the ground whenever

982
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:46,720
the heart of nations is deeply stirred by sentimental idealistic or practical considerations

983
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:54,080
fascism carries this anti-pacifistic attitude into the life of the individual i don't care a damn

984
01:34:54,080 --> 01:35:00,000
the proud motto of the fighting squads scrawled by a wounded man on his bandages is not only an

985
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,680
act of philosophic stoicism it sums up a doctrine which is not merely political it is evidence of a

986
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:12,400
fighting spirit which accepts all risks it signifies new style of italian life the fascist

987
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:18,160
accepts and loves life he rejects and despises suicide is cowardly life as he understand it

988
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:25,360
means duty elevation conquest life must be lofty and full it must be lived for oneself but above

989
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:32,240
all for others both nearby and far off present and future so it's it's still collectivist

990
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:37,840
it's just that the state becomes god the father to rule forever instead of self-sacrificial

991
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:46,960
to to to wither away at the peak of its power the population policy of the regime is the consequence

992
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:51,840
of these premises the fascist loves his neighbor but the word neighbor does not stand for some

993
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:57,280
vague and unceasable conception love of one's neighbor does not exclude necessary educational

994
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:02,320
severity in other words you can severely educate your neighbor to be a fascist

995
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:07,520
still less does it exclude differentiation and rank so it'll be very hierarchical who's on top

996
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:13,200
and who's not fascism will have nothing to do with universal embraces as a member of the community of

997
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:19,520
nations it looks other people's straight in the eyes it is vigilant and on guard it follows others

998
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:24,000
in their manifestations and notes any changes in their interests and it does not allow itself to

999
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:32,160
be deceived by mutable and fallacious appearances pillar rejection of marxism so as i was saying

1000
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:36,880
same in kind different degree it is the antithesis such a conception of life makes

1001
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:42,960
fascism the resolute negation of the doctrine underlying so-called scientific marxian marxian

1002
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:48,080
socialism the doctrine of historic materialism which would explain history of the history of

1003
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:52,720
mankind in terms of the class struggle and by changes in the processes and instruments of

1004
01:36:52,720 --> 01:37:00,080
production to the exclusion of all else so this by the way is why marxists consider everything

1005
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:05,280
they don't like that's opposed to them fascism because their kissing cousin which is fascism

1006
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:10,000
that evolved out of them as reaction is into antithetical reaction within the dialectical

1007
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:18,240
movement of history actually openly rejects them so as the open rejection of marxism is a pillar

1008
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:24,640
of fascism anything that rejects marxism must also be fascism and thus you see their stupid

1009
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:31,840
anti-fascist stand that the vicissitudes of economic life discoveries of raw materials new

1010
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:36,880
technical processes and scientific inventions have their importance no one denies but that they

1011
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:43,040
suffice to explain human history to the exclusion of other factors is absurd fascism believes now

1012
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:49,280
and always in sanctity and heroism that is to say in acts in which no economic motive remote

1013
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:56,560
or immediate is at work having denied historic materialism which sees men as seasoned men mere

1014
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:01,600
puppets on the surface of history appearing and disappearing on the crest of the waves while in

1015
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,880
the depths the real directing forces move and work fascism also denies the immutable and irreparable

1016
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:11,520
character of the class struggle which is the natural outcome of this economic conception of

1017
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:16,480
history see so fascists don't conceive economic history as the movement of economic forces

1018
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:22,160
colliding with one another it sees the movement of history as the ability for man to unify in duty

1019
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:30,160
around a state conception a state idol above all it denies that the class struggle is a preponderating

1020
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:36,480
agent in social transformations no it sees the state the unification within the state as the

1021
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:42,240
the the social transform uh transformation element having thus struck a blow at socialism

1022
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:46,720
and the two main points of his doctrine all that remains of it is the sentimental aspiration as

1023
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:51,760
old as humanity itself towards social relations in which the sufferings and sorrows of the humbler

1024
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:57,920
folk will be alleviated but here again fascism rejects the economic interpretation of felicity

1025
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:02,560
as something to be secured socialistically almost automatically at a given stage of economic

1026
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:09,840
evolution when all will be assured of a maximum of material comfort fascism denies the materialistic

1027
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,640
conception of happiness as a possibility and abandons it to the economists of the mid 18th

1028
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:20,640
century this means that fascism denies the equation well-being equals happiness which sees

1029
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:26,080
in men mere animals content when they can feed and fatten thus reducing them to a vegetative

1030
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:34,240
existence pure and simple rejection of parliamentary democracy as a sham and a fraud

1031
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:41,200
after socialism fascism trains its guns on the whole block of democratic ideologies and rejects

1032
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:45,920
both their premises and their practical applications and implements fascism denies

1033
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:50,480
that numbers as such can be the determining factor in human society so it's not really

1034
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:54,560
on that whole consent to the governed thing unless it forces the governed to consent to

1035
01:39:54,560 --> 01:40:00,640
the fascist government oh it manufactures a consent and it's idle it denies the right of

1036
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:04,800
numbers to govern by means of periodic consultations so we don't need elections

1037
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:12,080
it asserts the irredeemable infertile and beneficent inequality of men who cannot be

1038
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:18,240
leveled by any such mechanical and extrinsic device as universal suffrage so it embraces

1039
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:24,000
inequality and oppression as i've argued repeatedly democratic regimes may be

1040
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:29,920
may be described as those under which the people are from time to time deluded into the belief that

1041
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:35,760
they exercise sovereignty while all the time real sovereignty resides in and is exercised by

1042
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:40,800
other and sometimes irresponsible and secret forces all that can be true but that doesn't

1043
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:46,160
mean we need to throw away all of our power and our freedom and give it to irresponsible

1044
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:52,240
and secret forces in the form of a fascist state democracy is a kingless regime infested by many

1045
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:58,160
kings who are sometimes more exclusive tyrannical and destructive than one even if he be a tyrant

1046
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:03,280
this explains why fascism although for contingent reasons it was republican in tendency prior to

1047
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:09,360
1922 in other words it had to lie until it could take power properly abandoned that stand before

1048
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:14,800
the march on rome convinced that the form of government is no longer a matter of preeminent

1049
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:20,080
importance because the study of past and present monarchies and past and present republic shows

1050
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:27,440
that neither monarchy nor republic can be judged uh subspecies oh god it's in latin

1051
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:32,640
i turned not to say under the aspect of eternity i had to look it up that is as universally and

1052
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:39,440
eternally true so let me just read it in english um because the study of past and present monarchies

1053
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:44,720
and past and present republic shows that neither monarchy nor republic can be judged as universal

1054
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:50,320
and eternally true but that each stands for a form of government expressing the political

1055
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:55,840
evolution the history the traditions and the psychology of the given country fascism has

1056
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:01,440
outgrown the dilemma monarchy versus republic over which democratic regimes too long dallied

1057
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:06,480
attributing all insufficiencies to the former and proving the latter as a regime of perfection

1058
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:12,240
whereas experience teaches that some republics are inherently reactionary and absolutist while

1059
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:19,600
some monarchies accept the most daring political and social experiments in one of his philosophic

1060
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:26,480
meditations renan who had the pacifist institution a pre-fascist institution sorry remarks reason and

1061
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:31,920
science are the products of mankind but it is chimerical to seek reason directly for the people

1062
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:37,680
and through the people it is so elections bad it is not essential to the existence of reason that

1063
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:42,160
it should be that all should be familiar with it so lots of people shouldn't be qualified to vote

1064
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:46,880
and even if all had to be initiated this could not be achieved through democracy which seems

1065
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,760
fated to lead to the extinction of all arduous forms of culture and all highest forms of learning

1066
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,360
so only the people who understand the sense of fascism should really have the vote is what this

1067
01:42:55,360 --> 01:43:00,080
is saying the maxim that society exists only for the well-being and freedom of the individuals

1068
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:05,280
composing it does not seem to be in conformity with nature's plans which care only for the

1069
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:10,960
species and seem ready to sacrifice the individual it is much to be feared that the last word of

1070
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,520
democracy thus understood and let me hasten to add that it is susceptible for a different

1071
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:20,560
interpretation would be a form of society in which a degenerate mass would have no thought beyond

1072
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:26,880
that of enjoying the ignoble pleasures of the vulgar so it doesn't think much of democracy

1073
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:33,760
rejection of egalitarianism in rejecting democracy fascism rejects the absurd conventional lie of

1074
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:40,720
political equalitarianism the habit of collective irresponsibility the myth of felicity and

1075
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:48,640
indefinite progress definition of fascism as real democracy but if democracy be understood as

1076
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:54,000
meaning a regime in which the masses are not driven back to the margin of the state and then

1077
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:59,680
the writer of these pages has already defined fascism as an organized centralized authoritarian

1078
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:06,880
democracy this is identical to mao's conception of uh democratic centralism which probably borrowed

1079
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:12,960
from the fascists to be honest rejection of economic liberalism and admiration of bismarck

1080
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:18,320
fascism is definitely and absolutely opposed to the doctrines of liberalism

1081
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:23,360
both in the political and the economic sphere the importance of liberalism in the 19th century

1082
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:28,000
should not be exaggerated for present-day polemical purposes nor should we make of one

1083
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,520
of the many doctrines which flourished in that century a religion for mankind for the present

1084
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:39,760
and for all time to come liberalism really flourished for 15 years only it arose in 1930

1085
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:46,080
as a reaction to the holy alliance which tried to force europe to recede further back than 1789

1086
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:54,480
it touched zenith in 1848 when even pious the ninth was a liberal its decline began immediately

1087
01:44:54,480 --> 01:45:02,320
after that year if 1848 was a year of light and poetry 1849 was a year of darkness and tragedy

1088
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:07,200
the roman republic was killed by a sister republic that of france in that same year

1089
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:14,160
marx and his famous communist manifesto launched the gospel of socialism in 1851 napoleon the third

1090
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:19,600
made his a liberal coup d'etat and ruled france until 1870 when he was turned out by a popular

1091
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:25,440
rising following one of the severest military defeats known to history the victory was bismarck

1092
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:31,440
who never even knew the whereabouts of liberalism and its profits it is symptomatic that through the

1093
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:36,800
19th century the religion of liberalism was completely unknown to so highly civilized people

1094
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:43,040
as the germans but for one parenthesis which has been described as the ridiculous parliament of

1095
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:49,280
frankfurt which lasted just one season germany attained her national unity outside of liberalism

1096
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:55,120
and in opposition to liberalism that's a great thing to uphold here germany's done great a

1097
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:59,680
doctrine which seems foreign to the german temperament essentially monarchical whereas

1098
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:05,040
liberalism is the historical and logical anti-room to anarchy you hear that from the

1099
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:11,200
the new right today all the time but it's nonsense the three stages in the making of the german unity

1100
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:18,560
were the three wars of 1864 1866 and 1870 led by such liberals as moltke and bismarck and in the

1101
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:23,440
upbuilding of the italian unity liberalism played a very minor part when compared to the contribution

1102
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:29,680
made by mazzini and garibaldi who were not liberals but for the intervention of the illiberal

1103
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:35,200
napoleon the third we should not have had lombardi and without that of the illiberal bismarck at

1104
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:42,400
sadawa and at sadan we probably would not we would should not have had venetia in 1866 and in 1870 we

1105
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:49,040
would not have entered rome the years going from 1870 to 1915 cover a period which marked even in

1106
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:53,840
the opinion of the high priests of the new creed the twilight of their religion attacked by

1107
01:46:53,840 --> 01:47:00,240
decadentism in literature and by activism in practice activism that is to say nationalism

1108
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:07,200
futurism and fascism the liberal century after piling up innumerable gordian knots tried to cut

1109
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:13,120
them with the sword of the world war never has any religion claimed so cruel a sacrifice where the

1110
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:18,240
gods of liberalism thirsting for blood you hear these same kinds of arguments by the way from this

1111
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:23,440
new right today now liberalism is preparing to close the doors of its temples deserted by the

1112
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:29,280
peoples who feel that the agnosticism it professed in the sphere of economics and the indifferentism

1113
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:33,920
of which it has given proof in the spheres of politics and morals would lead the world to ruin

1114
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:39,280
in the future as they have done in the past this explains why all the political experiments of our

1115
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:44,480
day are anti-liberal and now we can look back 100 years later and see how those worked out which is

1116
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:49,760
really bad and it is supremely ridiculous to endeavor on this account to put them outside of

1117
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:56,240
the pale of history as though history were a perverse set a preserve set aside for liberalism

1118
01:47:56,240 --> 01:48:01,520
and its adepts as though liberalism were the last word in civilization beyond which no one can go

1119
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:06,240
well you tried to go past that with your fascist totalitarianism and it turned out to go really

1120
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:12,720
badly so the next section is called the fascist totalitarian vision of the future the fascist

1121
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:17,600
negation of socialism democracy liberalism should not however be interpreted as implying a desire

1122
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:24,560
to drive the world backwards to positions occupied prior to 1789 french revolution a year commonly

1123
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:30,240
referred to as that which opened the demo liberal century history does not travel backwards the

1124
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:36,720
fascist doctrine has not taken to master as its profit monarchical absolution absolutism is of

1125
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:44,000
the past and so is ecclesiology dead and done for our feudal privileges and the division of society

1126
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:49,760
into closed uncommunicating castes neither has the fascist conception of authority anything in common

1127
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:58,640
with that of a police-ridden state except in practice a party governing a nation totalitarianly

1128
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:03,440
is a new departure in history see you don't need police state when you just make everybody believe

1129
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:09,680
the right thing all the time there are no points of reference nor of comparison from beneath the

1130
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:14,560
ruins of liberal socialist and democratic doctrines fascism extracts those elements which are still

1131
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:20,640
vital it preserves what may be described as the acquired facts of history and rejects all else

1132
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:26,000
that is to say it rejects the idea of a doctrine suited to all times and to all people so it's

1133
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,240
going to just be a totalitarian state that does whatever it has to do to maintain power okay got

1134
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:35,920
you granted that the 19th century was the century of socialism liberalism democracy this does not

1135
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:40,800
mean that the 20th century must also be the century of socialism liberalism and democracy

1136
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:46,960
political doctrines pass nations remain we are free to believe that this is the century of authority

1137
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:52,960
a century tending to the right a fascist century now i actually disagree when he says

1138
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,640
here political doctrines pass the nations remain he says that nations are a people

1139
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:00,480
but i think that nations are actually constituted in their constitutions and so if you completely

1140
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:05,680
reorganize the political constitution of a country you actually have a new country you don't have the

1141
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:09,120
same nation you have a different nation it can call itself italy before and after but it's still

1142
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:15,920
a different nation and it's not just the people that's a that's a folkish way of thinking that's

1143
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:22,560
being resurrected today as it was being then if the 19th century was a century of the individual

1144
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:27,200
because liberalism implies individualism we're free to believe that this is the collective

1145
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:33,280
century and therefore the century of the state well there you have it folks state as an idol

1146
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:39,840
it is quite logical for a new doctrine to make use of the still vital elements of other doctrines

1147
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:46,000
no doctrine was ever born quite new and bright and unheard of no doctor can boast absolute

1148
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,960
originality it is always connected it only historically with those which preceded it and

1149
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:56,080
those which will follow it in other words fascism arose out of socialism it is the dialectical

1150
01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:02,880
antithesis which will lead to a synthesis of the two thus the scientific socialism of marx links

1151
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:08,240
up to the utopian socialism of the foyer's owens the saint simones thus the liberalism of the 19th

1152
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:13,200
century traces its origins back to the illuministic movement of the 18th that's straight projection

1153
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:18,480
it's the other way and the doctrines of democracy to those of the encyclopedist so he's blending the

1154
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:22,080
he's because he keeps saying 1789 what he's doing is he's taking the french

1155
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:30,720
revolution as emblematic of liberalism which that is incorrect in fact he is the communism followed

1156
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:35,920
from from the french revolution and fascism followed from communism liberalism has stood

1157
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:42,880
opposed to both all along so it's actually he's completely wrong on this in the same way that we

1158
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:47,600
see the the new right being wrong on these things today i wonder where they got their ideas well

1159
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:50,720
they are they're reading the fascist philosophers that's where they got their stupid ideas

1160
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:56,560
all doctrines aim at directing the activities of men he says toward a given objective

1161
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:01,760
but these activities in their turn react on the doctrine modifying and adjusting it to new needs

1162
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:08,080
or outstripping it a doctrine must therefore be a vital act and not a verbal display hence the

1163
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:13,680
pragmatic strain in fascism its will to power its will to live its attitude toward violence

1164
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:21,040
and its value next section is the absolute primacy of the state the keystone of the

1165
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:26,240
fascist doctrine is its conception of the state of its essence its functions and its aims for

1166
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:33,040
fascism the state is absolute individuals and groups relative individually so it's god it's

1167
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:38,880
the idol individuals and groups are admissible insofar as they come within the state instead

1168
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:43,520
of directing the game and guiding the material and moral progress of the community the liberal

1169
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,760
state restricts activities its activities to recording results the fascist state is wide awake

1170
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:56,080
and has a will of its own for this reason it can be described as ethical at the first quint

1171
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:03,520
quinquennial sorry assembly of the regime in 1929 i said the fascist state is not a night watchman

1172
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:08,960
solicitous only of the personal safety of the citizens nor is it organized exclusively for

1173
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:12,960
the purpose of guaranteeing a certain degree of material prosperity and relatively peaceful

1174
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:18,400
conditions of life a board of directors would do as much neither is it exclusively political

1175
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:23,280
divorced from practical realities and holding itself aloof from the multifarious activities

1176
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:28,720
of the citizens and the nation the state as conceived and realized by fascism is a spiritual

1177
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:35,280
and ethical entity for securing the political juridical and economic organization of the nation

1178
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:42,000
an organization which in its origin and growth is a manifestation of the spirit the state

1179
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,960
guarantees the internal and external safety of the country but it also safeguards and transmits

1180
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:53,600
the spirit of the people elaborated down the ages and its language its customs its faith the state

1181
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:59,280
is not only the present it is also the past and above all the future transcending the individual's

1182
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:04,480
brief spell of life the state stands for the imminent conscious conscience of the nation

1183
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:10,080
the forms in which it finds expression change but the need for it remains the state educates

1184
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:16,400
the citizens the civics makes them aware of their mission urges them to unity its justice

1185
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:21,760
harmonizes their divergent interests it transmits to future generations the conquests of the mind

1186
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:28,800
and the fields of science art law human solidarity it leads men from the primitive tribal life to

1187
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:36,240
that highest manifestation of human power which is imperial rule the state is an idol in fascism

1188
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:41,200
the state hands down to future generations the memory of those who laid down their lives to

1189
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:47,200
ensure its safety or to obey its laws it sets up as examples and records for the future ages

1190
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:51,840
the names of the captains who enlarged its territory and of the men of genius who made it

1191
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:57,680
famous whatever respect for the state declines in the disintegrating and centrifugal tendencies

1192
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:02,880
of individuals and groups prevail nations are headed for decay that's the end of his long quote

1193
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:10,080
there since 1929 economic and political development have everywhere emphasized these truths

1194
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:14,960
the importance of the state is rapidly growing the so-called crisis can only be settled by

1195
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:21,120
state action within the orbit of the state where are the shades of the jewels simons who in the

1196
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:26,160
early days of liberalism proclaimed that the state should endeavor to render itself useless and

1197
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:31,280
prepare to hand in its resignation of the mcculloughs who in the second half of this of the

1198
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:35,920
last century urged that the state should desist from governing too much and what of the english

1199
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:41,520
bentham who considered that all industry asked of government was to be left alone and of the german

1200
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:46,400
humbolt who expressed the opinion that the best government was a lazy one what would they say now

1201
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:52,080
to the unceasing inevitable and urgently requested interventions of government and business it is

1202
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:56,480
true that if the second generation of economists was less uncompromising this respect than the

1203
01:55:56,480 --> 01:56:01,520
first and even that adam smith left the door jar however cautiously for government intervention

1204
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:07,520
in business because if liberalism spells individualism fascism spells government and so

1205
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:12,720
that's your statement of fascism right there if liberalism spells individualism fascism spells

1206
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:19,280
government and what he's saying there just to summarize is that it was bs to ever think that

1207
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:23,440
the government wouldn't be involved in business public-private partnership or the the corporate

1208
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:30,560
subsidiarity state is exactly how things really work economically and work best he says the

1209
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:36,320
fascist state is however a unique and original creation it is not reactionary yes it is but

1210
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:41,680
revolutionary oh because it's a continuation of communism in another direction for it anticipates

1211
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:46,000
the solution of certain universal problems which have been raised elsewhere in the political field

1212
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:51,600
by the splitting up of parties the usurpation of power by parliaments the irresponsibility of

1213
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:56,160
assemblies in the economic field by the increasingly numerous and important functions

1214
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:02,240
discharged by trade unions and trade associations with the disputes and intents affecting both

1215
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:07,760
capital and labor in the ethical field by the need for felt the need felt for order discipline

1216
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:14,720
and obedience to the moral dictates of patriotism fascism desires the state to be strong and organic

1217
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:21,200
based on broad foundations of popular support fascist state lays claim to rule in the economic

1218
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:25,840
field no less than in others it makes its actions felt throughout the length and breadth of the

1219
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:31,360
country by means of its corporative social and educational institutions and all the political

1220
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:36,400
economic and spiritual forces of the nation organized in their respective associations

1221
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:42,720
circulate within the state a state based on millions of individuals who recognize its

1222
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:47,680
authority feel its action and are ready to serve its ends is not the tyrannical state of a medieval

1223
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:54,400
lordling has nothing in common with the despotic states existing prior to or subsequent to 1789 no

1224
01:57:54,400 --> 01:58:00,160
no it's totally different it's not despotic it's totalitarian that means everybody's entire life

1225
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:06,000
entire being has to be transformed and supporting the idol that's what it means just like with

1226
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,760
communism it is same and kind different in degree says far from crushing the individual you know

1227
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:16,080
here's more communist bullshit but it's fascist this time the fascist state multiplies his

1228
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:22,240
energies just as in the regiment of a soldier just as in a regiment a soldier is not diminished but

1229
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:26,640
multiplied by the number of his fellow soldiers the fascist state organizes the nation but it

1230
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:32,720
leaves the individual adequate elbow room sounds just like mao it has curtailed useless or harmful

1231
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:39,040
liberties oh it is curtailed useful useless or harmful liberties while preserving those which

1232
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:44,000
are essential in such matters the individual cannot be the judge but the state only so the

1233
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,480
state's going to decide what it is that you can and cannot do which of your liberties are useless

1234
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:53,840
and harmful in which are essential we just learned all about essential workers well here you have

1235
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:58,240
essential uh liberties that you're allowed to do and the rest are useless or harmful and the state

1236
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:03,440
will not permit them you as an individual have no right to choose anything to do with your own life

1237
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:08,000
and its liberties the state will choose them for you and extend them to you as privileges so do not

1238
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,960
let these people in the new right convince you that this is some higher expression of freedom

1239
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:17,600
that's the same lie that's been told by fascists and the same lie that's been told by communists for

1240
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:24,640
a hundred years the fascist state he tells us is not indifferent to religious phenomena in general

1241
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:29,920
nor does it maintain an attitude of indifference to roman catholicism the special positive religion

1242
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:35,200
of italians the state has not got a theology but it has a moral code oh it doesn't have a theology

1243
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:39,920
does it that's because it is its own theology he says the fascist state sees in religion one of the

1244
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:44,640
deepest spiritual manifestations and for this reason it is not it not only respects religion

1245
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:50,960
but defends and protects it some religions anyway the fascist state does not attempt as it rubs pierre

1246
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:54,720
at the height of the revolutionary delirium of the convention to set up a god of its own

1247
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:59,280
nor does it vainly seek as does bolshevism to efface god from the soul of man

1248
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:06,320
fascism respects the god of aesthetics st saints and heroes and it also respects god as conceived

1249
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:12,320
by the ingenuous and primitive heart of the people the god to whom their prayers are raised

1250
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:18,240
in other words it doesn't actually have a religious doctrine but it's going to make sure

1251
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:23,360
that you adhere to a religious doctrine and whichever one is fine it doesn't really care

1252
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:29,040
it's not really bringing god back into the picture the state is actually god but there's you're going

1253
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:34,160
to have to believe in some kind of a higher power god that the state is a reflection of

1254
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:40,240
the fascist state expresses the will to exercise power and to command it here the roman tradition

1255
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:45,840
is embodied in a conception of strength imperial power is understood by the fascist doctrine is

1256
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:51,840
not only territorial or military or commercial it is also spiritual and ethical an imperial

1257
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:57,440
nation that is to say a nation which directly or indirectly as a leader of others can exist without

1258
02:00:57,440 --> 02:01:03,360
the need of conquering a single square mile of territory fascism sees in the imperialistic spirit

1259
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:09,280
that is in the tendency of nations to expand a manifestation of their vitality in the opposite

1260
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:14,160
tendency which would limit their interest to the home country it sees a symptom of decadence

1261
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:20,880
peoples who rise or re-arise are imperialistic renunciation is characteristic of dying peoples

1262
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:26,400
the fascist doctrine is that best suited to the tendencies and feelings of a people which like the

1263
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:31,280
italian after lying fallow during centuries of foreign servitude are now reasserting itself

1264
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:38,160
in the world but imperialism implies discipline the coordination of efforts a deep sense of duty

1265
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:45,120
and a spirit of self-sacrifice so the state becomes the deity this explains many aspects

1266
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:51,280
of the practical activity of the regime and the direction taken by many of the forces of the state

1267
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:56,160
as also the severity which has to be exercised toward those who would oppose the spontaneous

1268
02:01:56,160 --> 02:02:01,440
and inevitable movement of the 20th century italy by agitating outgrown ideologies of the 19th

1269
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:06,160
century ideologies rejected wherever great experiments in political and social

1270
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:10,960
transformations are being dared we see where those ended up by the way in major ditches

1271
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:17,840
never before he says have the people thirsted for authority direction order as they do now so those

1272
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:23,120
are warning signs that that fascism is coming is that how you feel today is that what the new

1273
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:28,400
right is tapping into sounds like it if each age has its doctrine then innumerable symptoms

1274
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:35,360
indicate that the doctrine of our age is the fascist that it is vital excuse me that it is

1275
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:41,040
vital is shown by the fact that it has aroused a faith that this faith has conquered souls is shown

1276
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:47,440
by the fact that fascism can point to its fallen heroes and its martyrs fascism has now acquired

1277
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:52,400
throughout the world that universal that universally i guess universality which belongs

1278
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:59,520
to all doctrines which by achieving self-expression represent a moment in the history of human thought

1279
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:04,400
and so there's your expression of fascism that's what fascism is in the words of mussolini that is

1280
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:10,560
the doctrine of fascism we hear this arising from the so-called new right the dissident right that's

1281
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:16,160
not a good development we also see that it is actually the antithetical continuation of

1282
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:22,560
communism it is thesis antithesis synthesis is the main goal and so what you actually see here

1283
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:29,680
is a system of taking the state no longer as a self-sacrificing entity that liberates man from

1284
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:37,120
his own imprisonment but rather that it becomes a idol that through the worship of and fealty to

1285
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:43,440
the state becomes the guarantor of of man's supremacy this is this is a shift from

1286
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:50,240
as sick and upside down as it is to say communism holding up the state as a christ figure

1287
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:55,280
and it's a switch to the state being held up as a god figure as an emanating holy spirit that

1288
02:03:55,280 --> 02:04:00,800
will transform man into a functionary of the state as to an integral piece of the state and he's

1289
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:05,520
considered a non-entity without that the state gives him not just his soul but the soul of his

1290
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:11,760
soul and so this is idolatry of the grossest form i think it's very important that we reject

1291
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:17,600
this that we do not allow this to derail the movement against woke or the fight back against

1292
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:23,920
woke or whatever it is that we don't allow us to derail the upcoming election it being 2024 now

1293
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:30,240
and the election coming we don't we we know that the that the left broadly speaking will use this

1294
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:35,440
either as a means of directly seizing power if it has the capacity to do that to throw away liberty

1295
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:42,560
or if it cannot as a means to drive the resistance to the sustainable and inclusion woke movement

1296
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:46,160
that all that resistance is going to get driven into a ditch by promoting things that

1297
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:51,520
scare normal people into believing that it is an existential crisis for them to fight against

1298
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:58,640
conservatives this is why this is happening isn't it really good question i have severely severely

1299
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:04,000
cynical suspicions as to why people like franco are being pushed why fascism is being pushed

1300
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,560
why we're seeing all this uh rise of this kind of chest beating while we're seeing all this

1301
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:15,360
new misogyny this manliness characterized here in fascism by mussolini something bad is happening

1302
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:22,720
and um there's an explicit and deliberate push from agents of provocation or whatever on the

1303
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:28,640
internet toward fascism and we should be taking this very seriously and not losing track the

1304
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:32,880
answer lies in the constitution the answer lies in liberty the answer lies actually in the other

1305
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:39,840
1789 which was the the year of the constitution the answer lies in um putting human liberty first

1306
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:46,480
securing individual rights avoiding collectivism avoiding corporatism denying the idea of a

1307
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:52,080
corporate subsidiarity model that is going to be able to produce but removes all human freedom and

1308
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:56,960
makes us happy in the sense you know we'll own nothing and be happy in the sense that we are a

1309
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:02,960
part of the movement of history toward some kind of totalitarian end the thesis gives rise to the

1310
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:08,320
antithesis communism gives rise to fascism but in the end they're to be seen as the same in kind but

1311
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:13,680
different in degree two parts of the same coin and synthesized and fused into one model which is

1312
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:17,360
exactly what we see happening in the world which is why you see communism being pushed through

1313
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:23,360
corporations worldwide in china and here in the west through the un and the world economic forum

1314
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:31,760
in the world health organization

1315
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:54,740
you
